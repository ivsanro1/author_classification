2," Behind the bank or line our huts stood, having three other
huts behind them at a good distance.  In one of these, which was a little
one, and stood further off, we put our gunpowder, and nothing else, for
fear of danger; in the other, which was bigger, we dressed our victuals,
and put all our necessaries; and in the third, which was biggest of all,
we ate our dinners, called our councils, and sat and diverted ourselves
with such conversation as we had one with another, which was but
indifferent truly at that time"

4," From one extremity of this desert
to the other, the road was white with the bones of oxen and horses.  It
would hardly be an exaggeration to say that we could have walked the

prodigious graveyard"
5," As soon as the leopard felt herself struck, she reared up on her
two hind-legs, bolt upright, and throwing her forepaws about in the air,
fell backward, growling and struggling, and immediately died; the other

""Whatever it is, I can swear that it is of importance to us,"" said I. 
""I could read that on his face as he gave it. ""

""Unless we have come upon a primitive practical joker,"" Summerlee

untied their hands, and tied them two and two together by one foot. 

The third day of our march from this place our chief carpenter desired
us to halt, and set up some huts, for he had found out some trees that
he liked, and resolved to make us some canoes; for, as he told me, he
knew we should have marching enough on foot after we left the river, and
he was resolved to go no farther by land than needs must"
8," We gave it up and
tried the other.  Each man took a couple of sticks and fell to chafing
them together.  At the end of half an hour we were thoroughly chilled,
and so were the sticks.  We bitterly execrated the Indians, the hunters
and the books that had betrayed us with the silly device, and wondered
dismally what was next to be done"

In a moment the creature, beating and bumping along the wall like a

10," ""Admirable advice,"" says another. 
""Yes, yes,"" says the third (which was the gunner), ""the English dog has
given excellent advice; but it is just the way to bring us all to
the gallows.  The rogue has given us devilish advice, indeed, to go

13," With head erect and flashing eye she
stood a moment and then advanced, with her weapon raised.  The astonished
ruffian hesitated, and then fell back a step.  She followed.  She backed
him step by step into the middle of the bar-room, and then, while the
wondering crowd closed up and gazed, she gave him such another tongue-
lashing as never a cowed and shamefaced braggart got before, perhaps! As
she finished and retired victorious, a roar of applause shook the house,
and every man ordered “drinks for the crowd” in one and the same breath"

out in the evening papers that Private Miles, of the Coldstream Guards,
on duty outside Marlborough House, had deserted his post without leave,
and was therefore courtmartialed.   Private Miles' account, that he

What is the particular point upon which I, as an original investigator,

as much as possible: the old man lost what little self-possession he

23,"  I noticed a tall,
thin, angular man seated in an arm-chair by the fire.   He turned as I

He took a pill-box from his pocket, and spilled out of it a beautiful

“Well, Miss,” returned her maid, after considering, “I really couldn’t

""Midsummer madness!"" snorted Summerlee. 

Lord John was delighted with the whole idea.   ""Clever old dear, ain't

""The car will be my next care"

next, appearing in doubt as to whether the killing mania had reached its
climax, or whether we were to turn in and have a grand killing spell,
shooting whoever might have given us offence"

“This was more like it.  But I was unable to proceed.  I was too much
worn.  The word ‘turnips’ brought temporary joy and encouragement, but my

further, and resolved to do what I ought to have done at first"

We resolved to go on shore with our boats in the most convenient place
we could find, and to look out a proper harbour to bring the ship into,
leaving it to our fate whether we should meet with friends or enemies;

“I do not understand,” said Florence, gazing on her agitated face which

“I have dreamed,” said Edith in a low voice, “of a pride that is all
powerless for good, all powerful for evil; of a pride that has been
galled and goaded, through many shameful years, and has never recoiled
except upon itself; a pride that has debased its owner with the
consciousness of deep humiliation, and never helped its owner boldly to
resent it or avoid it, or to say, ‘This shall not be!’ a pride that,
rightly guided, might have led perhaps to better things, but which,
misdirected and perverted, like all else belonging to the same
possessor, has been self-contempt, mere hardihood and ruin"

Third. —I resolved completely to govern my outward manner and suppress

“You have almost reason to be, Madam,” he replied, glancing at a
variety of landscape drawings, of which he had already recognised
several as representing neighbouring points of view, and which were

some cutlasses; and the negroes had hid them below where they lay.  We

“The wery planks she walked on,” murmured the Captain, looking at her

With a few blows from the machetes of our Indians we cleared the spot

did was to take an observation, and see whereabouts in the world we

minutes south of the line.  The next thing was to look on the charts, and
see the coast of the country we aimed at, which we found to be from 8 to
11 degrees south latitude, if we went for the coast of Angola, or in 12
to 29 degrees north latitude, if we made for the river Niger, and the

This mill was a six-stamp affair, driven by steam.  Six tall, upright
rods of iron, as large as a man’s ankle, and heavily shod with a mass of
iron and steel at their lower ends, were framed together like a gate,

an iron box called a “battery"

Upon this the captain, who had won much upon the rest of his men by what
he had said to them, and was very easy as to the general peace (for it
was very true that the most mutinous of the men were gone), came out
to the quarter-deck, and, calling the men together, let them know the
substance of the letter, and told the men that, however they had not
deserved such civility from him, yet he was not willing to expose them
more than they were willing to expose themselves; he was inclined to
send them some ammunition, and as they had desired but one barrel of
powder, he would send them two barrels, and shot, or lead and moulds to
make shot, in proportion; and, to let them see that he was civiller to
them than they deserved, he ordered a cask of arrack and a great bag
of bread to be sent them for subsistence till they should be able to

“Not yet,” assents the Captain.  “No.  Not yet. ”

Susan and Mr Toots are of the same opinion.  After a silence they all

At length she cannot see it plainly, for the tears that fill her eyes;

We asked our black prince what we should do with them.  ""Me go,"" says he,

William did not care at first to go near him, but the man continuing to

set her foresail with the tack at the cat-head, and lashed her helm a
little to starboard, to answer her head-sail, and so set her agoing,
with neither cat or dog in her; and it was not above two hours before
we saw her run right ashore upon the coast, a little beyond the
Cape Comorin; and away we went round about Ceylon, for the coast of
Coromandel"

And it was comfort in those succeeding days to sit up and contemplate
the majestic panorama of mountains and valleys spread out below us and
eat ham and hard boiled eggs while our spiritual natures revelled
alternately in rainbows, thunderstorms, and peerless sunsets"

In the meantime I took possession of the Portuguese man-of-war; and
Captain Wilmot made me, or rather I made myself, captain of her for
the present.  About thirty of their seamen took service with us, some of
which were French, some Genoese; and we set the rest on shore the next
day on a little island on the coast of Brazil, except some wounded men,
who were not in a condition to be removed, and whom we were bound to
keep on board; but we had an occasion afterwards to dispose of them at
the Cape, where, at their own request, we set them on shore"
77," It is said that the pleasure that lit Slade’s face when he heard
of it was something fearful to contemplate.  He examined his enemy to see
that he was securely tied, and then went to bed, content to wait till
morning before enjoying the luxury of killing him"

have I done to be looked at, like that?”

“My lad,” said Captain Cuttle, “don’t you sing out afore you’re hurt. 
And don’t you commit yourself, whatever you do. ”

“I haven’t been and committed nothing, Captain!” answered Rob"

While William and I were talking, the poor Dutchmen were openly
condemned to die, as it may be called, by the whole ship's company; and
so warm were the men upon it, that they grew very clamorous; and when
they heard that William was against it, some of them swore they should
die, and if William opposed it, he should drown along with them"
81,"
Indeed, my design was always for the Cape de Bona Speranza, and so to
the East Indies.  I had heard some flaming stories of Captain Avery,
and the fine things he had done in the Indies, which were doubled and
doubled, even ten thousand fold; and from taking a great prize in
the Bay of Bengal, where he took a lady, said to be the Great Mogul's
daughter, with a great quantity of jewels about her, we had a story told
us, that he took a Mogul ship, so the foolish sailors called it, laden
with diamonds"

When we came up to the field of battle, we saw a great number of bodies

we could not tell what to make of it; but at length we found how it
was, viz"

“May I come in, or shall I speak here?” said the woman, catching at her
hand. 

“What is it that you want? What is it that you have to say?”

“Not much, but let me say it out, or I shall never say it"
84," In the fight that had ensued,
four Indians were captured, and the main body chased four miles, but
nobody killed.  This looked like business.  We had a notion to get out and
join the sixty soldiers, but upon reflecting that there were four
hundred of the Indians, we concluded to go on and join the Indians"
85," “Right again! you had.  Now I’ve
took the liberty of coming here—

“Won’t you sit down?” said Mr Carker, smiling. 

“Thank’ee,” returned the Captain, availing himself of the offer.  “A man
does get more way upon himself, perhaps, in his conversation, when he
sits down"
86," We told them
our present want was provisions, which they had no need of, being just
at the end of their voyage; and that, if they would send their boat on
shore with ours, and procure us six-and-twenty head of black cattle,
threescore hogs, a quantity of brandy and arrack, and three hundred
bushels of rice, we would let them go free"

Then Kalaimoku came to the house, and the chiefs had a consultation.  One
of them spoke thus: ‘This is my thought—we will eat him raw.  [This
sounds suspicious, in view of the fact that all Sandwich Island

They were careless, easy-going fellows, as a general thing, and the

""I thought he wouldn't face the fire,"" said Lord John, laughing, as he

""You should not have taken such a risk!"" we all cried. 

""There was nothin' else to be done"

“A pack of idle dogs!” said Mrs Pipchin, “only fit to be turnspits.  Go

The weak-eyed young man went, very meekly, to discharge himself of this

“Proud of his love, I am,” said Harriet, looking full upon her visitor,
and changing her manner on the instant—not that it was less composed
and quiet, but that there was a deep impassioned earnestness in it that
made the very tremble in her voice a part of her firmness, “and proud
of him"
93,"  At the worst, then, we
should be back in a few days at our starting-point. 

We made a march that day which totaled some two-and-twenty miles,
without any change in our prospects.   I may mention that our aneroid
shows us that in the continual incline which we have ascended since we
abandoned our canoes we have risen to no less than three thousand feet
above sea-level"
94,"  I suppose they were ten miles off from me, yet even at that
distance one could observe how, from time to time, they twinkled or
were obscured as someone passed before them.   What would I not have
given to be able to crawl up to them, to peep in, and to take back some
word to my comrades as to the appearance and character of the race who
lived in so strange a place!  It was out of the question for the
moment, and yet surely we could not leave the plateau until we had some
definite knowledge upon the point"
95," In a dark corner of the dark church,
Florence has turned to Susan Nipper, and is weeping in her arms.  Mr
Toots’s eyes are red.  The Captain lubricates his nose.  Uncle Sol has
pulled down his spectacles from his forehead, and walked out to the
door"
96,"E.  and N. N. E. , we led it away, with the wind large, to the
Maldives, a famous ledge of islands, well known by all the sailors who
have gone into those parts of the world; and, leaving these islands a
little to the south, we made Cape Comorin, the southernmost land of the
coast of Malabar, and went round the isle of Ceylon"
97," We
decided that a tunnel was the thing we wanted. 



212. jpg (89K)



So we went down the mountain side and worked a week; at the end of which
time we had blasted a tunnel about deep enough to hide a hogshead in,
and judged that about nine hundred feet more of it would reach the
ledge"
98,"  The ground shook beneath
his tremendous weight, and his gulpings of water resounded through the
still night.   For five minutes he was so close to my rock that by
stretching out my hand I could have touched the hideous waving hackles
upon his back"
99,"  Suddenly an exclamation broke from Lord Roxton. 

""It's blocked!"" said he. 

Clustering behind him we saw in the yellow field of light a wall of
broken basalt which extended to the ceiling. 

""The roof has fallen in!""

In vain we dragged out some of the pieces"
100,"” The city and all
the great mountain side were riddled with mining shafts.  There were more
mines than miners.  True, not ten of these mines were yielding rock worth
hauling to a mill, but everybody said, “Wait till the shaft gets down
where the ledge comes in solid, and then you will see!” So nobody was
discouraged"
101," And when these grew tiresome we dashed boldly into
the midst of a school of huge, beastly porpoises engaged at their
eternal game of arching over a wave and disappearing, and then doing it
over again and keeping it up—always circling over, in that way, like so
many well-submerged wheels"
102,"”

Here the Major, under cover of the dark room, shut up one eye, rolled
his head like a Harlequin, and, in his great self-satisfaction, perhaps
went nearer to the confines of apoplexy than he had ever gone before"
103," If so be as he’s alive, my
opinion is he will.  Do I say he will? No.  Why not? Because the bearings
of this obserwation lays in the application on it. ”

“Bunsby!” said Captain Cuttle, who would seem to have estimated the
value of his distinguished friend’s opinions in proportion to the
immensity of the difficulty he experienced in making anything out of
them; “Bunsby,” said the Captain, quite confounded by admiration, “you
carry a weight of mind easy, as would swamp one of my tonnage soon"
104," A
thing like a guide-board was elevated above this pen on a tall pole, and
formerly there was an inscription upon it describing the memorable
occurrence that had there taken place; but the sun and the wind have
long ago so defaced it as to render it illegible"
105,"E. , we stretched off, and got above a league more sea-room in
half-an-hour.  After that, it blew with some fury S. W.  by S. , then S. W. 
by W. , and put us back again a great way to the eastward of the ledge
of rocks, where we found a great opening between the rocks and the land,
and endeavoured to come to an anchor there, but we found there was no
ground fit to anchor in, and that we should lose our anchors, there
being nothing but rocks"
106,"”

“Yes, Sir,” returned Rob. 

“I have a great interest in that old gentleman, and in serving him, you
serve me, boy, do you understand? Well,” he added, interrupting him,
for he saw his round face brighten when he was told that: “I see you
do"
107,"  Summerlee was weaponless, but I was emptying my
magazine as quick as I could fire, and on the further flank we heard
the continuous cracking of our companion's rifles. 

Then in a moment came the panic and the collapse"
108,"

In the late afternoon we reached the margin of the lake, and as we
emerged from the bush and saw the sheet of water stretching before us
our native friends set up a shrill cry of joy and pointed eagerly in
front of them"
109," Had we had canoes or
any boats which might have been carried by men's strength we might have
gone two hundred miles more up this river in small boats, but our great
boat could go no farther. 

All this way the country looked green and pleasant, and was full of
cattle, and some people we saw, though not many; but this we observed
now, that the people did no more understand our prisoners here than
we could understand them; being, it seems, of different nations and of
different speech"
110,"

""Is all ready for your journey?"" he asked. 

""We can start to-morrow. ""

""Then so you shall.   You need no chart of directions now, since you
will have the inestimable advantage of my own guidance.   From the first
I had determined that I would myself preside over your investigation"
111,"""

""What story?""

""Oh, it was rank nonsense about some queer animals he had discovered. 
I believe he has retracted since.   Anyhow, he has suppressed it all. ""

""How?""

""Well, by his insufferable rudeness and impossible behavior"
112,"

The darkness of the forest had been alarming, but even worse was the
white, still flood of moonlight in the open glade of the iguanodons. 
Hid among the bushes, I looked out at it.   None of the great brutes
were in sight"
113," We ventured, I say, and the rather because we saw very high
mountains in our way at a great distance, and we imagined, wherever
there were mountains there would be springs and rivers; where rivers
there would be trees and grass; where trees and grass there would
be cattle; and where cattle, some kind of inhabitants"
114," It was plain that he
considered the Captain one of the most amiable of men, and a man whom
it was an honour to a dog to know. 

In evidence of these convictions, Diogenes attended on the Captain
while he made some tea and toast, and showed a lively interest in his
housekeeping"
115,"

In due course of time our journey came to an end at Kawaehae (usually
pronounced To-a-_hi_—and before we find fault with this elaborate
orthographical method of arriving at such an unostentatious result, let
us lop off the _ugh_ from our word “though”)"
116,"

From hence, the weather settling again, we went on and came to the
southernmost part of Mindanao, where we took in fresh water and some
cows, but the climate was so hot that we did not attempt to salt up any
more than so as to keep a fortnight or three weeks; and away we stood
southward, crossing the line, and, leaving Gillolo on the starboard
side, we coasted the country they call New Guinea, where, in the
latitude of eight degrees south, we put in again for provisions and
water, and where we found inhabitants; but they fled from us, and were
altogether inconversable"
117," But deep
consideration at length assured Mr Toots that an important step to
gain, was, the conciliation of Miss Susan Nipper, preparatory to giving
her some inkling of his state of mind. 

A little light and playful gallantry towards this lady seemed the means
to employ in that early chapter of the history, for winning her to his
interests"
118,"  From then onwards, we were in truth
masters of the plateau, for the natives looked upon us with a mixture
of fear and gratitude, since by our strange powers we had aided them to
destroy their hereditary foe"
119," Drownded, ain’t he?” after which he would
resume his smoking with infinite gentleness. 

Unlike as they were externally—and there could scarcely be a more
decided contrast than between Florence in her delicate youth and
beauty, and Captain Cuttle with his knobby face, his great broad
weather-beaten person, and his gruff voice—in simple innocence of the
world’s ways and the world’s perplexities and dangers, they were nearly
on a level"
120,"  I dare say that I could
throw myself over a precipice, like the Hun in the history books, if my
courage to do it were questioned, and yet it would surely be pride and
fear, rather than courage, which would be my inspiration"
121," I saw a piece of cement as large as my fist which was said to have
been given to Whiteman by the young German, and it was of a seductive
nature.  Lumps of virgin gold were as thick in it as raisins in a slice
of fruit cake"
122," There was a great pile of it
strapped on top of the stage, and both the fore and hind boots were
full.  We had twenty-seven hundred pounds of it aboard, the driver
said—“a little for Brigham, and Carson, and ’Frisco, but the heft of it
for the Injuns, which is powerful troublesome ’thout they get plenty of
truck to read"
123," But this part I bury in silence for the present. 

We increased our stock in these two years considerably, having taken
60,000 pieces of eight in one vessel, and 100,000 in another; and being
thus first grown rich, we resolved to be strong too, for we had taken a
brigantine built at Virginia, an excellent sea-boat, and a good sailer,
and able to carry twelve guns; and a large Spanish frigate-built ship,
that sailed incomparably well also, and which afterwards, by the help
of good carpenters, we fitted up to carry twenty-eight guns"
124,"

“My dear,” retorted Mrs Chick, in a low voice: “Her Mama, all over!”

“In-deed!” said Miss Tox.  “Ah dear me!”

A tone of most extraordinary compassion Miss Tox said it in, though she
had no distinct idea why, except that it was expected of her"
125,"  Sweden was also represented, in the person of Professor
Sergius, the famous Zoologist of the University of Upsala.   The
entrance of the four heroes of the occasion was the signal for a
remarkable demonstration of welcome, the whole audience rising and
cheering for some minutes"
126," She looked down again, and
put out her trembling hand. 

Mr Dombey took it loosely in his own, and stood looking down upon her
for a moment, as if he knew as little as the child, what to say or do. 

“There! Be a good girl,” he said, patting her on the head, and
regarding her as it were by stealth with a disturbed and doubtful look"
127,"  The filthy beasts fingered me all over,
and I feel as if I should never be clean again.   Old
Challenger was up a tree, eatin' pines and havin' the time of his life. 
I'm bound to say that he managed to get some fruit to us, and with his
own hands he loosened our bonds"
128,"

“Pray allow me,” said Mr Dombey.  “Or Carker will do it better, as he
understands these things.  Carker, have the goodness to see to these
pencils for Mrs Granger. ”

Mr Carker rode up close to the carriage-door on Mrs Granger’s side, and
letting the rein fall on his horse’s neck, took the pencils from her
hand with a smile and a bow, and sat in the saddle leisurely mending
them"
129,"  It was a fitting avenue
to a land of wonders.   All sign of the Indians had passed away, but
animal life was more frequent, and the tameness of the creatures showed
that they knew nothing of the hunter"
130,"

But the wind veering again in the night, and blowing exceedingly hard,
our anchors came home, and the ship drove till the rudder struck against
the ground; and had the ship gone half her length farther she had been
lost, and every one of us with her"
131,"  There we can move faster than they.   So we must stick to
the open all we can.   The edge of the plateau has fewer large trees
than further inland.   So that's our line of advance.   Go slowly, keep
your eyes open and your rifle ready"
132," We took it all carefully
up, and washing it in the water, the loamy earth washed away, and left
the gold dust free in our hands; and that which was more remarkable was,
that, when this loose earth was all taken away, and we came to the rock
or hard stone, there was not one grain of gold more to be found"
133,"

""My dear chap, things don't happen like that in real life.   People
don't stumble upon enormous discoveries and then lose their evidence. 
Leave that to the novelists.   The fellow is as full of tricks as the
monkey-house at the Zoo"
134,"

“Why, my love,” said Mr Toots, “it’s from Captain Gills.  Do not excite
yourself.  Walters and Miss Dombey are expected home!”

“My dear,” said Mrs Toots, raising herself quickly from the sofa, very
pale, “don’t try to deceive me, for it’s no use, they’re come home—I
see it plainly in your face!”

“She’s a most extraordinary woman!” exclaimed Mr Toots, in rapturous
admiration"
135,"""

A slip of hard wood had been nailed to the tree in such a way as to
point to the westward. 

""Most certainly a sign-post,"" said Challenger.   ""What else?  Finding
himself upon a dangerous errand, our pioneer has left this sign so that
any party which follows him may know the way he has taken"
136," Don’t go on like this, if
you please.  Oh, couldn’t you have the goodness to put in a word for a
miserable cove, here?” said the Grinder, appealing in desperation to
the daughter. 

“Come, mother, you hear what he says,” she interposed, in her stern
voice, and with an impatient action of her head; “try him once more,
and if you fall out with him again, ruin him, if you like, and have
done with him"
137," “You mean it, and have reason, say
disgrace. ”

“From that disgrace,” assented his brother with keen emphasis, “but is
the fact to be blurted out and trumpeted, and proclaimed continually in
the presence of the very House! In moments of confidence too? Do you
think your name is calculated to harmonise in this place with trust and
confidence, John Carker?”

“No,” returned the other"
138," This was a very plausible tale, and was easily believed;
and, if you observe the manner of the negroes' sailing, and what
happened in their voyage, was every word of it true. 

By this method, and being true to one another, William passed for what
he was--I mean, for a very honest fellow; and by the assistance of one
planter, who sent to some of his neighbour planters, and managed the
trade among themselves, he got a quick market; for in less than five
weeks William sold all his negroes, and at last sold the ship itself,
and shipped himself and his twenty men, with two negro boys whom he had
left, in a sloop, one of those which the planters used to send on board
for the negroes"
139,"”

“No,” said Edith, “no, dearest.  I am best left alone now, and I do best
to keep apart from you, of all else.  Ask me no questions, but believe
that what I am when I seem fickle or capricious to you, I am not of my
own will, or for myself"
140," ""Captain Bob,"" says he, ""I think you must be our
leader, for all the success of this enterprise is owing to you. "" ""No,
no,"" said I, ""do not compliment me; you shall be our Seignior Capitanio,
you shall be general; I am too young for it"
141," Plainly
this was the road to fortune.  The great “Gould and Curry” mine was held
at three or four hundred dollars a foot when we arrived; but in two
months it had sprung up to eight hundred.  The “Ophir” had been worth
only a mere trifle, a year gone by, and now it was selling at nearly
_four thousand dollars a foot_! Not a mine could be named that had not
experienced an astonishing advance in value within a short time"
142," When it was time to withdraw
upstairs again, she would have sent Florence into the inner room to say
good-night to her father, but the child was timid and drew back; and
when she urged her again, said, spreading her hands before her eyes, as
if to shut out her own unworthiness, “Oh no, no! He don’t want me"
143,"’

“After this conversation the body was taken into the consecrated house
for the performance of the proper rites by the priest and the new King. 
The name of this ceremony is uko; and when the sacred hog was baked the
priest offered it to the dead body, and it became a god, the King at the
same time repeating the customary prayers"
144,"  Think of the woman he loved, and how other women must have
envied her!  That's what I should like to be,--envied for my man. ""

""I'd have done it to please you. ""

""But you shouldn't do it merely to please me"
145,"”

“A boat with a sail,” repeated Paul, “in the full light of the moon. 
The sail like an arm, all silver.  It went away into the distance, and
what do you think it seemed to do as it moved with the waves?”

“Pitch,” said Mr Toots"
146," On the contrary it is plain that it is the
most solemn and awful that ever man was called upon to decide. 
Gentlemen, I have listened attentively to the evidence, and have
perceived that the weight of it, the overwhelming weight of it, is in
favor of the plaintiff Hyde"
147,"

""Pray do. ""

""It proves,"" he roared, with a sudden blast of fury, ""that you are the
damnedest imposter in London--a vile, crawling journalist, who has no
more science than he has decency in his composition!""

He had sprung to his feet with a mad rage in his eyes"
148,"  I
hand it to you now, and I ask you to take it page by page and to
examine the contents. ""

He helped himself to a cigar and leaned back with a fiercely critical
pair of eyes, taking note of the effect which this document would
produce"
149," Oh! they might set you on fire. 

_W_.  Set us a-firing, thou meanest; that they might indeed; but set us
on fire they shall not; they may try, at their peril, and we shall make
mad work with your hundred thousand men, if they come within reach of
our guns, I assure thee"
150,"  Waldron, though a hardened
lecturer and a strong man, became rattled.   He hesitated, stammered,
repeated himself, got snarled in a long sentence, and finally turned
furiously upon the cause of his troubles"
151," We shook hands and agreed to say no more
about “reform” and “examples to the rising generation. ”

The station we were at was at the verge of the Twenty-six-Mile Desert. 
If we had approached it half an hour earlier the night before, we must
have heard men shouting there and firing pistols; for they were
expecting some sheep drovers and their flocks and knew that they would
infallibly get lost and wander out of reach of help unless guided by
sounds"
152," D.  Allen our partner (the foreman) put in a sudden
appearance about that time, with a cocked revolver in his hand, and said
his name must be added to the list, or he would “thin out the Johnson
company some"
153," But the
English nation had so grand a genius for punctuality.  Ah! what noise!
Great Heaven, here was Monsieur.  Behold him!”

In effect, Monsieur, admitted by the other of the two, came, with his
gleaming teeth, through the dark rooms, like a mouth; and arriving in
that sanctuary of light and colour, a figure at full length, embraced
Madame, and addressed her in the French tongue as his charming wife"
154,"

“Upon my word and honour,” said Mr Toots, earnestly, “I should be very
much obliged to you if you’d improve my acquaintance.  I should like to
know you, Captain, very much.  I really am in want of a friend, I am"
155,", and fine promising
weather, we came all into the first proposal, and resolved for the coast
of Africa; nor were we long in disputing as to our coasting the island
which we were upon, for we were now upon the wrong side of the island
for the voyage we intended; so we stood away to the north, and, having
rounded the cape, we hauled away southward, under the lee of the island,
thinking to reach the west point of land, which, as I observed before,
runs out so far towards the coast of Africa, as would have shortened our
run almost 100 leagues"
156,"  ""Living, as I do,
in an educated and scientific atmosphere, I could not have conceived
that the first principles of zoology were so little known.   Is it
possible that you do not know the elementary fact in comparative
anatomy, that the wing of a bird is really the forearm, while the wing
of a bat consists of three elongated fingers with membranes between?
Now, in this case, the bone is certainly not the forearm, and you can
see for yourself that this is a single membrane hanging upon a single
bone, and therefore that it cannot belong to a bat"
157,"”

“No—but are you in earnest?”

“Indeed I am. ”

“I will go along too. ”

“Why of course you will. ”

“What part of Europe shall you go to?”

“All parts.  France, England, Germany—Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Syria,
Greece, Palestine, Arabia, Persia, Egypt—all over—everywhere"
158,"  It was
the most rational remark which I had heard in Enmore Park.   ""Well,"" he
insisted, turning to me, ""what is it, then?""

""This man attacked me,"" said I. 

""Did you attack him?"" asked the policeman"
159,"”

“What o’clock was that?” said the Captain, prepared to be very
particular about the exact time. 

“How can I tell, Captain!” answered Rob.  “I only know that I’m a heavy
sleeper at first, and a light one towards morning; and if Mr Gills had
come through the shop near daybreak, though ever so much on tiptoe, I’m
pretty sure I should have heard him shut the door at all events"
160,"  Within an hour we had brought up the rifles and a shot-gun. 
The half-breeds had ascended also, and under Lord John's orders they
had carried up a bale of provisions in case our first exploration
should be a long one"
161,"  They took us out to see it,
and the whole tribe lined up on the edge.   Four of the Indians jumped,
and the canes went through 'em like knittin' needles through a pat of
butter.   No wonder we found that poor Yankee's skeleton with the canes
growin' between his ribs"
162," He merely brought
it out, at a certain stage of his first evening pipe, laid it on the
table, and sat gazing at the outside of it, through the smoke, in
silent gravity, for two or three hours at a spell"
163," His whole form,
but especially his face and head, dilated beyond all former experience;
and presented to the dark man’s view, nothing but a heaving mass of
indigo.  At length he burst into a violent paroxysm of coughing, and
when that was a little better burst into such ejaculations as the
following:

“Would you, Ma’am, would you? Mrs Dombey, eh, Ma’am? I think not,
Ma’am"
164,", that the flesh of their goats, and their beef also,
but especially the former, when we had dried and cured it, looked red,
and ate hard and firm, as dried beef in Holland; they were so pleased
with it, and it was such a dainty to them, that at any time after they
would trade with us for it, not knowing, or so much as imagining what it
was; so that for ten or twelve pounds' weight of smoke-dried beef, they
would give us a whole bullock, or cow, or anything else we could desire"
165," It has only
snowed twice in San Francisco in nineteen years, and then it only
remained on the ground long enough to astonish the children, and set
them to wondering what the feathery stuff was.

166,"] Reporting was lucrative, and every man
in the town was lavish with his money and his “feet.  These were nearly all “wild cat” mines, and wholly
worthless, but nobody believed it then.  The “Ophir,” the “Gould &
Curry,” the “Mexican,” and other great mines on the Comstock lead in
Virginia and Gold Hill were turning out huge piles of rich rock every
day, and every man believed that his little wild cat claim was as good
as any on the “main lead” and would infallibly be worth a thousand
dollars a foot when he “got down where it came in solid"
167," The See Yup Company is held to be the
largest of these.  The Ning Yeong Company is next, and numbers eighteen
thousand members on the coast.  Its headquarters are at San Francisco,
where it has a costly temple, several great officers (one of whom keeps
regal state in seclusion and cannot be approached by common humanity),
and a numerous priesthood"
168,"


We rumbled over the plains and valleys, climbed the Sierras to the
clouds, and looked down upon summer-clad California.  And I will remark
here, in passing, that all scenery in California requires _distance_ to
give it its highest charm"
169," ""Why then,
friend William,"" said I, ""what would you have us do? You see what
condition we are in, and what is before us; something must be done, and
that immediately. "" ""Why,"" says William, ""I'll tell thee what thou shalt
do; first, cause a white flag to be hanged out, as they do to us, and
man out the longboat and pinnace with as many men as they can well stow,
to handle their arms, and let me go with them, and thou shalt see what
we will do"
170," Lately
evidences of bituminous coal have been detected.  My theory has ever been
that coal is a ligneous formation.  I told Col.  Whitman, in times past,
that the neighborhood of Dayton (Nevada) betrayed no present or previous
manifestations of a ligneous foundation, and that hence I had no
confidence in his lauded coal mines"
171," At Lloyd’s, they give up the Son and Heir for lost.  Well, she was
insured, from her keel to her masthead. ”

“Carker,” said Mr Dombey, taking a chair near him, “I cannot say that
young man, Gay, ever impressed me favourably—”

“Nor me,” interposed the Manager"
172,"""

""Very well,"" says William; ""but it seems there is some bearing a worse
condition; and so you will shoot yourself, that you may be past remedy?""

""I am past remedy already,"" says I. 

""How do you know that?"" says he"
173," The
expression he communicated to the instrument at first, though
monstrously pathetic and bland, was nothing to the expression he
communicated to his own face, and bestowed upon the empty chair: which
was so sincere, that he was obliged to have recourse to Captain
Cuttle’s remedy more than once, and to rub his face with his sleeve"
174,"  It
was Summerlee who first broke the silence. 

""You don't mean us to go up in that thing, Challenger?"" said he, in an
acid voice. 

""I mean, my dear Summerlee, to give you such a demonstration of its
powers that after seeing it you will, I am sure, have no hesitation in
trusting yourself to it"
175,"

“Beg your pardon, Sir,” resumed Toodle, taking a step before them and
deferentially stopping them again, still cap in hand: “I wouldn’t have
troubled you with such a pint except as a way of gettin’ in the name of
my son Biler—christened Robin—him as you was so good as to make a
Charitable Grinder on"
176,"

While we mused upon this discovery, we were surprised with very bad
weather, and especially violent rains, with thunder and lightning,
most unusually terrible to us.  In this pickle we run for the shore, and
getting under the lee of the cape, run our frigates into a little creek,
where we saw the land overgrown with trees, and made all the haste
possible to get on shore, being exceeding wet, and fatigued with the
heat, the thunder, lightning, and rain"
177," So this scene of my life may be said to
have begun in theft, and ended in luxury; a sad setting-out, and a worse
coming home. 

About the year ---- I began to see the bottom of my stock, and that
it was time to think of further adventures; for my spoilers, as I call
them, began to let me know, that as my money declined, their respect
would ebb with it, and that I had nothing to expect of them further than
as I might command it by the force of my money, which, in short, would
not go an inch the further for all that had been spent in their favour
before"
178,", that if any man appeared to assault them,
or shoot at them to offer any violence to them, they might kill them;
but that they should not offer to kill or hurt any that offered them
peace, or laid down their weapons, nor any women or children, upon any
occasion whatsoever"
179," They could then say nothing to
that.  ""Then,"" says William, ""if I mistake not, your business is money;
now, I desire to know, if you conquer and kill two or three thousand of
these poor creatures, they have no money, pray what will you get? They
are poor naked wretches; what shall you gain by them? But then,"" says
William, ""perhaps, in doing this, you may chance to lose half-a-score of
your own company, as it is very probable you may"

Thus these quiet spirits pass the evening; and when it has yielded
place to night, Mr Toots walks home with Mr Feeder, and parts with him
at Doctor Blimber’s door.  But Mr Feeder only goes up the steps, and
when Mr Toots is gone, comes down again, to stroll upon the beach
alone, and think about his prospects"
181," Arrived at the top, you find a busy crowd of men receiving the
ascending cars and tubs and dumping the ore from an elevation into long
rows of bins capable of holding half a dozen tons each; under the bins
are rows of wagons loading from chutes and trap-doors in the bins, and
down the long street is a procession of these wagons wending toward the
silver mills with their rich freight"
182,"

This suited very well with our purpose; so I resolved now that we would
leave off being pirates and turn merchants; so we told them what goods
we had on board, and that if they would bring their supercargoes or
merchants on board, we would trade with them"
183,"  ""Come, come!"" he rumbled. 

""I am, of course, a mere student,"" said I, with a fatuous smile,
""hardly more, I might say, than an earnest inquirer. 

""Well, of course, I am aware that there is not any what you might call
DEFINITE evidence"
184,""" I found
he was not just then upon the operation as to his leg, but was mixing
up something to give the poor creature, to repel, as I thought, the
spreading contagion, and to abate or prevent any feverish temper that
might happen in the blood; after which he went to work again, and opened
the leg in two places above the wound, cutting out a great deal of
mortified flesh, which it seemed was occasioned by the bandage, which
had pressed the parts too much; and withal, the blood being at the time
in a more than common disposition to mortify, might assist to spread it"
185,"""

""Challenger's sketch-book. ""

""You think he drew that animal?""

""Of course he did.   Perhaps, after all, I had been premature in my
acquiescence.   Then I had a sudden happy thought. 

""Will you come to the meeting?"" I asked"
186," You will be good enough to
observe, Carker, that no message to Mrs Dombey with which you are or
may be charged, admits of reply.  You will be good enough to bring me no
reply.  Mrs Dombey is informed that it does not become me to temporise
or treat upon any matter that is at issue between us, and that what I
say is final"
187,"

Now the rosy children living opposite to Mr Dombey’s house, peep from
their nursery windows down into the street; for there are four black
horses at his door, with feathers on their heads; and feathers tremble
on the carriage that they draw; and these, and an array of men with
scarves and staves, attract a crowd"
188,"  ""Where are the
professors?  And who is it that is after us?""

""The ape-men,"" he cried.   ""My God, what brutes!  Don't raise your
voice, for they have long ears--sharp eyes, too, but no power of scent,
so far as I could judge, so I don't think they can sniff us out"
189," The air was heavy with the fragrance of flowers.  The halt was
brief. —Gayly laughing and talking, the party galloped on, and I clung to
the pommel and cantered after.  Presently we came to a place where no
grass grew—a wide expanse of deep sand"
190,"” Mrs MacStinger spoke loud, and listened for any
observations that might be offered from the first floor. 

“I’ll mention it,” said Walter, “if you’ll have the goodness to let me
in, Ma’am. ”

For he was repelled by a wooden fortification extending across the
doorway, and put there to prevent the little MacStingers in their
moments of recreation from tumbling down the steps"
191,"  The same short, broad figure, the same heavy shoulders, the
same forward hang of the arms, the same bristling beard merging itself
in the hairy chest.   Only above the eyebrows, where the sloping
forehead and low, curved skull of the ape-man were in sharp contrast to
the broad brow and magnificent cranium of the European, could one see
any marked difference"
192," Just go in and toot your horn, if you don’t
sell a clam.  Put Buck through as bully as you can, pard, for anybody
that knowed him will tell you that he was one of the whitest men that
was ever in the mines"
193,"

“You are quite right, Mr Gills,” says Mr Dombey.  “This is a very rare
and most delicious wine. ”

The Captain, who is of the party, beams with joy.  There is a very halo
of delight round his glowing forehead"

The station-keeper upended a disk of last week’s bread, of the shape and
size of an old-time cheese, and carved some slabs from it which were as
good as Nicholson pavement, and tenderer"
195,"  I got down, therefore, and pondered over what I should do. 
Finally, I closed the door of the zareba, lit three separate fires in a
triangle, and having eaten a hearty supper dropped off into a profound
sleep, from which I had a strange and most welcome awakening"

""Who is he?

""One of our Indians.   Other ones beat him and take away his pay.   He

197," At about twenty-six years
of age he killed a man in a quarrel and fled the country.  At St.  Joseph,
Missouri, he joined one of the early California-bound emigrant trains,
and was given the post of train-master"
198,"  At the same time,
it seemed to me that you were a little severe upon Weissmann in this
matter.   Has not the general evidence since that date tended to--well,
to strengthen his position?""

""What evidence?""  He spoke with a menacing calm"
199," At length Mrs Chick looked at Miss Tox,
and Miss Tox returned the look, and they both rose and said it was
really time to go.  Mr Dombey receiving this announcement with perfect
equanimity, they took leave of that gentleman, and presently departed
under the protection of Mr Chick; who, when they had turned their backs
upon the house and left its master in his usual solitary state, put his
hands in his pockets, threw himself back in the carriage, and whistled
“With a hey ho chevy!” all through; conveying into his face as he did
so, an expression of such gloomy and terrible defiance, that Mrs Chick
dared not protest, or in any way molest him"
200," He
cut out elephants, tigers, civet cats, ostriches, eagles, cranes, fowls,
fishes, and indeed whatever he pleased, in thin plates of hammered gold,
for his silver and iron were almost all gone. 

At one of the towns of these savage nations we were very friendly
received by their king, and as he was very much taken with our workman's
toys, he sold him an elephant cut out of a gold plate as thin as a
sixpence at an extravagant rate"
201," We picked up a lot of them for
mementoes.  I got quite a number of arm bones and leg bones—of great
chiefs, may be, who had fought savagely in that fearful battle in the
old days, when blood flowed like wine where we now stood—and wore the
choicest of them out on Oahu afterward, trying to make him go"
202,"

The head of the column now wheeled into Wallace street and marched up at
quick time.  Halting in front of the store, the executive officer of the
committee stepped forward and arrested Slade, who was at once informed
of his doom, and inquiry was made as to whether he had any business to
settle"
203,"  It
was Summerlee who opened the debate.   All day he had been querulous in
manner, and now some remark of Lord John's as to what we should do on
the morrow brought all his bitterness to a head. 

""What we ought to be doing to-day, to-morrow, and all the time,"" said
he, ""is finding some way out of the trap into which we have fallen"
204,"""

""And I may come?"" I asked eagerly. 

""Why, surely,"" he answered, cordially.   He had an enormously massive
genial manner, which was almost as overpowering as his violence.   His
smile of benevolence was a wonderful thing, when his cheeks would
suddenly bunch into two red apples, between his half-closed eyes and
his great black beard"
205," ""Come on. ""

I rose from my chair and he from his.   Then with a little confidential
chuckle of laughter, he patted me two or three times on the chest,
finally pushing me back into my chair. 

""All right, sonny my lad--you'll do,"" said he"
206,"W. , which
was the very course we desired to go. 

On the farthest bank of this brook, we perceived some huts of negroes,
not many, and in a little low spot of ground, some maize, or Indian
corn, growing, which intimated presently to us, that there were some
inhabitants on that side less barbarous than what we had met with in
other places where we had been"
207," I am now personally acquainted with seventy-two captains and
ninety-six missionaries.  The captains and ministers form one-half of the
population; the third fourth is composed of common Kanakas and
mercantile foreigners and their families, and the final fourth is made
up of high officers of the Hawaiian Government"
208," The button is hammered out flat and thin, put in
the furnace and kept some time at a red heat; after cooling it off it is
rolled up like a quill and heated in a glass vessel containing nitric
acid; the acid dissolves the silver and leaves the gold pure and ready
to be weighed on its own merits"
209,"

“Not the lad I speak on,” said the Captain. 

“Thank God! oh thank God!”

“Amen!” returned the Captain hurriedly.  “Don’t be took aback! A minute
more, my lady lass! with a good heart!—aboard that ship, they went a
long voyage, right away across the chart (for there warn’t no touching
nowhere), and on that voyage the seaman as was picked up with him died"
210," I would not have them do you any hurt then, neither. 

W.  But prithee, friend, do not make thyself fool and knave too.  Dost not
thou know that we are out of fear of all thy army, and out of danger
of all that they can do? What makes thee act so simply as well as so
knavishly?

D"
211," Thinking that might be too melancholy, he
corrected it with a chuckle.  Not thoroughly pleasing himself with
either mode of reply, he breathed hard. 

“You were very kind to my dear brother,” said Florence, obeying her own
natural impulse to relieve him by saying so"
212," I begged them to come out, for the sea was rising and I was
satisfied that they were running some risk.  But they were not afraid,
and presently went on with their sport.  They were finished swimmers and
divers, and enjoyed themselves to the last degree"
213," These, finding a Charitable
Grinder in the midst of them—unaccountably delivered over, as it were,
into their hands—set up a general yell and rushed upon him. 

But it so fell out likewise, that, at the same time, Polly, looking
hopelessly along the road before her, after a good hour’s walk, had
said it was no use going any further, when suddenly she saw this sight"
214,"  In front of them a porter pushes
a trolley piled high with trunks, wraps, and gun-cases.   Professor
Summerlee, a long, melancholy figure, walks with dragging steps and
drooping head, as one who is already profoundly sorry for himself"
215,"

“Stoker,” said the man.  “Steam ingine. ”

“Oh-h! Yes!” returned Miss Tox, looking thoughtfully at him, and
seeming still to have but a very imperfect understanding of his
meaning. 

“And how do you like it, Sir?”

“Which, Mum?” said the man"
216,"  ""An enormous
blood-tick, as yet, I believe, unclassified. ""

""The first-fruits of our labors,"" said Challenger in his booming,
pedantic fashion.   ""We cannot do less than call it Ixodes Maloni.   The
very small inconvenience of being bitten, my young friend, cannot, I am
sure, weigh with you as against the glorious privilege of having your
name inscribed in the deathless roll of zoology"

“How long it is before we have any news of Walter, Susan!” observed
Florence, after a moment’s silence. 

“Long indeed, Miss Floy!” replied her maid.  “And Perch said, when he
came just now to see for letters—but what signifies what he says!”
exclaimed Susan, reddening and breaking off"
218,"

After some time, William, taking out his glass to look at it more
nearly, was surprised with hearing a musket-shot whistle by him, and
immediately after that he heard the gun, and saw the smoke from the
other side; upon which our men immediately fired three muskets, to
discover, if possible, what or who they were"
219," All nature was gray with it.  We
were plowing through great deeps of powdery alkali dust that rose in
thick clouds and floated across the plain like smoke from a burning
house. 

We were coated with it like millers; so were the coach, the mules, the
mail-bags, the driver—we and the sage-brush and the other scenery were
all one monotonous color"
220,", or S. W.  by W. , and never further from the west; so that,
in a word, we could make nothing of it. 

On the other hand, the vessel, such as we had, would not lie close upon
a wind; if so, we might have stretched away N"

to take it. ""

""But chances are all around you.   It is the mark of the kind of man I
mean that he makes his own chances.   You can't hold him back.   I've
never met him, and yet I seem to know him so well"
222," Waldron whispered to the chairman, who half rose and said something
severely to his water-carafe. )  ""But enough of this!""  (Loud and
prolonged cheers. )  ""Let me pass to some subject of wider interest"
223," This water gave the road a soapy appearance, and in
many places the ground looked as if it had been whitewashed.  I think the
strange alkali water excited us as much as any wonder we had come upon
yet, and I know we felt very complacent and conceited, and better
satisfied with life after we had added it to our list of things which
_we_ had seen and some other people had not"
224,"

But this is from the purpose.  Polly only thought, at that time, of
improving on her successful propitiation of Miss Nipper, and devising
some means of having little Florence aide her, lawfully, and without
rebellion"
225," We would squander
half a column of adulation on a shaft, or a new wire rope, or a dressed
pine windlass, or a fascinating force pump, and close with a burst of
admiration of the “gentlemanly and efficient Superintendent” of the
mine—but never utter a whisper about the rock"
226," T. ] Kaahumanu (one of the dead King’s widows)
replied, ‘Perhaps his body is not at our disposal; that is more properly
with his successor.  Our part in him—his breath—has departed; his remains
will be disposed of by Liholiho"
227,"  We are held here with no clear means of making our escape, and
bitterly we chafe against it.  Yet, I can well imagine that the day may
come when we may be glad that we were kept, against our will, to see
something more of the wonders of this singular place, and of the
creatures who inhabit it"
228," We looked out very narrowly
for some river or creek or bay, where we might run in, and come to an
anchor, but found none a great while.  At length we saw a great headland
lie out far south into the sea, and that to such a length, that, in
short, we saw plainly that, if the wind held where it was, we could not
weather it, so we ran in as much under the lee of the point as we could,
and came to an anchor in about twelve fathom water"
229,"  I'm goin' with our little red pals and I mean to see them
through the scrap.   What do you say, young fellah?""

""Of course I will come. ""

""And you, Challenger?""

""I will assuredly co-operate. ""

""And you, Summerlee?""

""We seem to be drifting very far from the object of this expedition,
Lord John"
230," But they sat on him again, and changed their verdict to “suicide
induced by mental aberration”—because, said they, with penetration, “he
said he was dead, and he _was_ dead; and would he have told the truth if
he had been in his right mind? No, sir"
231,"W.  Here we rode about sixteen days,
the winds being very tempestuous and the weather uncertain.  However, we
got some provisions on shore, such as plants and roots, and a few hogs. 
We believed there were inhabitants on the island, but we saw none of
them"
232,"  By your own admission you only
saw a bird. ""

""A pterodactyl. ""

""That's what HE says.   He put the pterodactyl into your head. ""

""Well, then, the bones?""

""First one out of an Irish stew.   Second one vamped up for the
occasion"
233,"—’ At’s what I say—they’re dangerous.  If a
man—(’ic!)—if a man wants to feed a dog on rocks, let him _feed_ him on
rocks; ’at’s all right; but let him keep him at _home_—not have him
layin’ round promiscuous, where (’ic!) where people’s liable to stumble
over him when they ain’t noticin’!”

It was not without regret that I took a last look at the tiny flag (it
was thirty-five feet long and ten feet wide) fluttering like a lady’s
handkerchief from the topmost peak of Mount Davidson, two thousand feet
above Virginia’s roofs, and felt that doubtless I was bidding a
permanent farewell to a city which had afforded me the most vigorous
enjoyment of life I had ever experienced"
234,"”

Her features gradually softened; and suffering Florence to come closer
to her, within her embrace, she said in a tender manner, “But what does
my bird do here? What does my bird do here?”

“I have been uneasy, Mama, in not seeing you tonight, and in not
knowing how Papa was; and I—”

Florence stopped there, and said no more"
235," But when she
hurried out upon the staircase, and saw the frightened servants going
up and down with lights, and whispering together, and falling away from
her father as he passed down, she awoke to a sense of her own
powerlessness; and hiding in one of the great rooms that had been made
gorgeous for this, felt as if her heart would burst with grief"
236,"

“Ah! By-the-bye,” said Walter, stopping, “let me see; where are we? Oh!
I know.  But the offices are shut up now, Miss Dombey.  There’s nobody
there.  Mr Dombey has gone home long ago.  I suppose we must go home too?
or, stay"
237,"

There are several rivers in Nevada, and they all have this mysterious
fate.  They end in various lakes or “sinks,” and that is the last of
them.  Carson Lake, Humboldt Lake, Walker Lake, Mono Lake, are all great
sheets of water without any visible outlet"
238,"

Accordingly we stood away north, but found ourselves so entangled among
innumerable islands, and without any pilot that understood the channel
and races between them, that we were obliged to give it over, and
resolved to go back again to Banda, and see what we could get among the
other islands thereabouts"
239," “Barnet,” to Master
Skettles, who was revenging himself for the studies to come, on the
plum-cake, “this is a young gentleman you ought to know.  This is a
young gentleman you may know, Barnet,” said Sir Barnet Skettles, with
an emphasis on the permission"
240," I thought I had enough already, and
all the thoughts I had about disposing of it, if I came to Europe, was
only how to spend it as fast as I could, buy me some clothes, and go to
sea again to be a drudge for more"
241," It comes right over the mountains from the
West, but when one crosses the ridge he does not find any of it on the
other side! It probably is manufactured on the mountain-top for the
occasion, and starts from there"
242," I recalled my promises of reform
and preached to myself persuasively, upbraidingly, exhaustively.  But it
was all vain, I shortly found myself sneaking among the snow-drifts
hunting for my pipe.  I discovered it after a considerable search, and
crept away to hide myself and enjoy it"
243,"  The
Indians were so terrified at it that they would not go near the place,
and, though we twice made expeditions and saw it each time, we could
not make our way through the deep marsh in which it lived"
244," Under us, and stretching away before us, was
a heaving sea of molten fire of seemingly limitless extent.  The glare
from it was so blinding that it was some time before we could bear to
look upon it steadily"
245," Do remember the
medical man! Captain Gills says—at least he don’t say, but I imagine,
from what I can make out, he means—that Miss Dombey has brought her
unfortunate father away from his old house, to one where she and
Walters are living; that he is lying very ill there—supposed to be
dying; and that she attends upon him night and day"
246,"  We could not--or at least
we had not succeeded up to date in making organic life in our
laboratories out of inorganic materials.   The gulf between the dead and
the living was something which our chemistry could not as yet bridge"
247,"  I had regarded his presence
as an encumbrance to the expedition, but, as a matter of fact, I am now
well convinced that his power of endurance is as great as my own.   In
temper he is naturally acid and sceptical"
248," or N.  by E. , as the other river had done
which I mentioned before. 

My friend the gunner, upon examining, said that he believed that he was
mistaken before, and that this was the river Nile, but was still of the
mind that we were of before, that we should not think of a voyage into
Egypt that way; so we resolved upon crossing this river, which, however,
was not so easy as before, the river being very rapid and the channel
very broad"
249,"

“And Sol Gills,” said the Captain, gazing at the fire, “poor nevyless
old Sol, where are you got to! you was left in charge of me; his last
words was, ‘Take care of my Uncle!’ What came over you, Sol, when you
went and gave the go-bye to Ned Cuttle; and what am I to put in my
accounts that he’s a looking down upon, respecting you! Sol Gills, Sol
Gills!” said the Captain, shaking his head slowly, “catch sight of that
there newspaper, away from home, with no one as know’d Wal”r by, to say
a word; and broadside to you broach, and down you pitch, head
foremost!”

Drawing a heavy sigh, the Captain turned to Mr Toots, and roused
himself to a sustained consciousness of that gentleman’s presence"
250,"  You'll look silly, some o' these days, when
someone comes along an' sneaks the honey.   But you'll need to hold your
gun straight in South America, for, unless our friend the Professor is
a madman or a liar, we may see some queer things before we get back"
251,"  Since landing from the boat he has
obtained some consolation from the beauty and variety of the insect and
bird life around him, for he is absolutely whole-hearted in his
devotion to science.   He spends his days flitting through the woods
with his shot-gun and his butterfly-net, and his evenings in mounting
the many specimens he has acquired"
252," I told them we had
marched 700 miles of our way, and it would be worse than death to
think of going back again; and that, if they thought the desert was not
passable, I thought we should rather change our course, and travel south
till we came to the Cape of Good Hope, or north to the country that lay
along the Nile, where, perhaps, we might find some way or other over to
the west sea; for sure all Africa was not a desert"
253,"

Among the negroes that were killed in this battle there was one who had
a little thin bit or plate of gold, about as big as a sixpence, which
hung by a little bit of a twisted gut upon his forehead, by which we
supposed he was a man of some eminence among them; but that was not all,
for this bit of gold put us upon searching very narrowly if there was
not more of it to be had thereabouts, but we found none at all"
254,"”

“People who have enough to do to hold their own way,” said Mr Dombey,
unobservant of the Captain’s mysterious signs behind Walter, and still
looking at his son, “had better be content with their own obligations
and difficulties, and not increase them by engaging for other men"
255," When you see Ned Cuttle bite his nails, Wal”r, then you may
know that Ned Cuttle’s aground. ”

Thereupon the Captain put his iron hook between his teeth, as if it
were a hand; and with an air of wisdom and profundity that was the very
concentration and sublimation of all philosophical reflection and grave
inquiry, applied himself to the consideration of the subject in its
various branches"
256,"  ""And now, having demonstrated this important
conclusion so that it is clear to anyone, however prejudiced or obtuse,
I am of opinion that we cannot do better than break up our camp and
travel to westward until we find some means of ascent"
257,"
It had a hellish ugly deformed look and voice, and our men would not be
persuaded but it was the devil, only that we did not know what business
Satan could have there, where there were no people. 

It was very remarkable that we had now travelled 1000 miles without
meeting with any people in the heart of the whole continent of Africa,
where, to be sure, never man set his foot since the sons of Noah spread
themselves over the face of the whole earth"
258," The case
was, that the two who went out with their bows and arrows, meeting with
a great herd of deer in the plain, had been so nimble as to shoot three
of them, and then one of them came running to us for help to fetch them
away"
259,"'

""There, take it with you.   I've nothing more for you to-night. ""

I pocketed the slip of paper. 

""One moment, sir,"" I said, as I realized that it was a pink bald head,
and not a red face, which was fronting me"
260," It was probably the first time whiskey ever
prominently figured as an aid to civilization.  Liholiho came up to
Kailua as drunk as a piper, and attended a great feast; the determined
Queen spurred his drunken courage up to a reckless pitch, and then,
while all the multitude stared in blank dismay, he moved deliberately
forward and sat down with the women!

They saw him eat from the same vessel with them, and were appalled!
Terrible moments drifted slowly by, and still the King ate, still he
lived, still the lightnings of the insulted gods were withheld! Then
conviction came like a revelation—the superstitions of a hundred
generations passed from before the people like a cloud, and a shout went
up, “the _tabu_ is broken! the _tabu_ is broken!”



521"
261,"
Good-bye!” And poor Mr Toots, who was dying to accept the invitation,
but hadn’t the courage to do it, signed to the Chicken, with an aching
heart, and away went the Joy, cleaving the water like an arrow"
262," The fact is, that Jack was invited down to a
marriage—which I think took place in Berkshire?”

“Shropshire,” said the bold mild man, finding himself appealed to. 

“Was it? Well! In point of fact it might have been in any shire,” said
Cousin Feenix"
263," He
would go on with a musing repetition of the title of his old firm
twenty thousand times, and at every one of them, would turn his head
upon his pillow.  He would count his children—one—two—stop, and go back,
and begin again in the same way"
264," Nor could we see any end of
it either before us, which was our way, or to the right hand or left;
so that truly our men began to be discouraged, and talk of going back
again.  Nor could we indeed think of venturing over such a horrid place
as that before us, in which we saw nothing but present death"
265,"

But at length one of the natives, a black negro-man, showed us a tree,
the wood of which being put into the fire, sends forth a liquid that is
as glutinous and almost as strong as tar, and of which, by boiling, we
made a sort of stuff which served us for pitch, and this answered our
end effectually; for we perfectly made our vessel sound and tight, so
that we wanted no pitch or tar at all"
266," Here, of a sudden, was a bloody footstep going on
among the others; and after it there began to be, at intervals, doors
standing open, through which certain terrible pictures were seen, in
mirrors, of haggard men, concealing something in their breasts"
267,"

“I hope, Towlinson,” says Miss Tox, who, in her instruction of the
Toodle family, has acquired an admonitorial tone, and a habit of
improving passing occasions, “that what has happened here, will be a
warning to you, Towlinson"
268," And finally, this train was rich, very rich in cattle,
horses, mules and other property—and how could the Mormons consistently
keep up their coveted resemblance to the Israelitish tribes and not
seize the “spoil” of an enemy when the Lord had so manifestly “delivered
it into their hand?”

Wherefore, according to Mrs"
269,"

With this purpose he slunk into a railway carriage as quickly as he
could, and lying there wrapped in his cloak as if he were asleep, was
soon borne far away from the sea, and deep into the inland green"
270," Dear me, where is she?”

“Edith, my dear!” cried Mrs Skewton, “where are you? Looking for Mr
Dombey somewhere, I know.  We are here, my love. ”

The beautiful lady released her hold of Florence, and pressing her lips
once more upon her face, withdrew hurriedly, and joined them"
271," I thought tamarinds
were made to eat, but that was probably not the idea.  I ate several, and
it seemed to me that they were rather sour that year.  They pursed up my
lips, till they resembled the stem-end of a tomato, and I had to take my
sustenance through a quill for twenty-four hours"
272,"  At a
rough guess the gulf was forty feet across, but, so far as I could see,
it might as well have been forty miles.   I placed one arm round the
trunk of the tree and leaned over the abyss.   Far down were the small
dark figures of our servants, looking up at us"
273," As she looked upon it now, she saw it, for the first time,
free from the cloud that had darkened her childhood.  Calm, tranquil
night was reigning in its stead.  He might have gone to sleep, for
anything she saw there, blessing her"
274," I am no such thing.  Why
should I be penitent, and all the world go free? They talk to me of my
penitence.  Who’s penitent for the wrongs that have been done to me?”

She rose up, bound her handkerchief about her head, and turned to move
away"
275," Cut it in twain, and the product is enormous, far
transcending any previous developments of our racy Territory. 

A very common calculation is that many of our mines will yield five
hundred dollars to the ton"

he.  So he comes back into our tent, and falls to making some artificial
fireworks and the like; and he gave our sentinels some to be ready
at hand upon occasion, and particularly he placed a great piece of
wild-fire upon the same pole that the mat had been tied to, and set it
on fire, and that burnt there so long that all the wild creatures left
us for that time"

from the east, along the shore, at about the distance of two leagues,
which was to our particular satisfaction, she having been missing
thirteen days"

Nobody will imagine we could be so dull as not to gather from hence that
we might take the same method for our escape; so we resolved first, in
general, that we would try if possible to build us a boat of one kind or
other, and go to sea as our fate should direct"
279,"

At the end of a week we adjourned to the Sierras on a fishing excursion,
and spent several days in camp under snowy Castle Peak, and fished
successfully for trout in a bright, miniature lake whose surface was
between ten and eleven thousand feet above the level of the sea; cooling
ourselves during the hot August noons by sitting on snow banks ten feet
deep, under whose sheltering edges fine grass and dainty flowers
flourished luxuriously; and at night entertaining ourselves by almost
freezing to death"

length on his lounge, his legs hung down over the end, and when he
snored he woke the dead.  These facts are all attested by irrefragable
tradition.

knowed more about mining, that cat did, than any man _I_ ever, ever see. 
You couldn’t tell _him_ noth’n ’bout placer diggin’s—’n’ as for pocket

282,"  It was pleasant to see the convolvulus, the
passion-flower, and the begonia, all reminding me of home, here among
these inhospitable rocks.   There was a red begonia just the same color
as one that is kept in a pot in the window of a certain villa in
Streatham--but I am drifting into private reminiscence"

intention of returning, and yet every time my pride conquered my fear,
and sent me on again until my object should be attained. 

At last (my watch showed that it was one in the morning) I saw the

Good-night!”

Still covering her face, she sobbed, and answered “Good-night, dear

""Our young friend here knows where they live.   I gather that it is some

""A good twenty miles,"" said I. 

Summerlee gave a groan. 

""I, for one, could never get there.   Surely I hear those brutes still
howling upon our track"
286," It is bounded on one side—where the murder was done—by a
little flat plain, on which stands a cocoanut grove and some ruined
houses; a steep wall of lava, a thousand feet high at the upper end and
three or four hundred at the lower, comes down from the mountain and
bounds the inner extremity of it"
287," and S. S. E. , we were obliged to come to an anchor
under a little island, and wait for a wind.  In this time the Portuguese
had, it seems, given notice over land to the governor there, that a
pirate was upon the coast; so that, when we came in view of the port, we
saw two men-of-war riding just without the bar, whereof one, we found,
was getting under sail with all possible speed, having slipped her
cable on purpose to speak with us; the other was not so forward, but was
preparing to follow"

up against it, so what's the decision?""

""It seems a most questionable step,"" said Summerlee, argumentative to
the last, ""but if you are all going, I hardly see how I can remain
behind. ""

""Then it is settled,"" said Lord John, and turning to the chief he
nodded and slapped his rifle"

This Dutchman was very glad of an acquaintance, because he soon found
that we directed our thoughts to Europe also; and as he found we were
encumbered with goods only (for we let him know nothing of our money),
he readily offered us his assistance to dispose of as many of them as
the place we were in would put off, and his advice what to do with the
rest"
290," Though Mrs Pipchin got very greasy, outside, over this dish, it
didn’t seem to lubricate her internally, at all; for she was as fierce
as ever, and the hard grey eye knew no softening. 

After tea, Berry brought out a little work-box, with the Royal Pavilion

The maid who should have been a skeleton, then reappeared, and giving

We were now a good troop, being in all twenty-seven men, very well
armed, and provided with everything but victuals; we had two carpenters
among us, a gunner, and, which was worth all the rest, a surgeon or
doctor; that is to say, he was an assistant to a surgeon at Goa, and was
entertained as a supernumerary with us"
294,"  They tied us up--the
fellow who handled me could tie like a bosun--and there we lay with our
toes up, beneath a tree, while a great brute stood guard over us with a

back harder.  What else did you expect?”

“Harder to me! To her own dear mother!” cried the old woman

“I don’t know who began to harden me, if my own dear mother didn’t,”
she returned, sitting with her folded arms, and knitted brows, and
compressed lips as if she were bent on excluding, by force, every
softer feeling from her breast"
296," We broke twigs
from a sage bush and piled them on a little cleared place in the shelter
of our bodies.  In the course of ten or fifteen minutes all was ready,
and then, while conversation ceased and our pulses beat low with anxious
suspense, Ollendorff applied his revolver, pulled the trigger and blew
the pile clear out of the county! It was the flattest failure that ever
was"

And so we put it off, in a sort of general way, till next day—and that

298,"

Our men were terrified at them at first, and began to discover an
unusual fear, and even our black prince seemed in a great deal of
confusion; but I smiled at him, and showing him some of our guns, I
asked him if he thought that which killed the spotted cat (for so they
called the leopard in their language) could not make a thousand of those
naked creatures die at one blow? Then he laughed, and said, yes, he
believed it would"

But we were perfectly friendly.  The day that the school report was next
due, the proprietor of the “Genessee” mine furnished us a buggy and
asked us to go down and write something about the property—a very common
request and one always gladly acceded to when people furnished buggies,
for we were as fond of pleasure excursions as other people"

large numbers of ladies which prevented an absolute riot.   Suddenly,
however, there was a pause, a hush, and then complete silence. 
Professor Challenger was on his feet"
301," Having described the genesis of their journey, and paid a
handsome tribute to his friend Professor Challenger, coupled with an
apology for the incredulity with which his assertions, now fully
vindicated, had been received, he gave the actual course of their
journey, carefully withholding such information as would aid the public
in any attempt to locate this remarkable plateau"
302,"

I represented the hazard, and indeed the impossibility, of his passing
by Mocha and Jiddah without being attacked, if he offered it by force,
or plundered, if he went to get leave; and explained the reasons of it
so much and so effectually, that, though at last he would not hearken to
it himself, none of his men would go with him"
303," It
presently came into my head, that we might now, by the law of arms, take
as many prisoners as we would, and make them travel with us, and carry
our baggage.  As soon as I proposed it, our men were all of my mind; and
accordingly we secured about sixty lusty young fellows, and let them
know they must go with us; which they seemed very willing to do"
304,"

This I say of the negro natives, which we soon came among; but as to
these poor people that he lived among, they were not much acquainted
with things, being at the distance of above 300 miles from the coast;
only that they found elephants' teeth upon the hills to the north, which
they took and carried about sixty or seventy miles south, where other
trading negroes usually met them, and gave them beads, glass, shells,
and cowries, for them, such as the English and Dutch and other traders
furnish them with from Europe"
305," She had risen, as the nurse said, and the lashes of her eyes
were wet with tears.  But no one saw them glistening save Polly.  No one
else leant over her, and whispered soothing words to her, or was near
enough to hear the flutter of her beating heart"
306," “Do you know better than anyone, that you

“Then I hope, Carker,” said Mr Dombey, “that your regret in the
acquisition of Mrs Dombey’s displeasure, may be almost counterbalanced

But Susan cannot bear that Florence should go away with a mournful
recollection of her.  She had meant to be so different, that she

308," They would not come on the side where the fire was; and though we
thought ourselves secure everywhere else, yet we all got up and took to
our arms.  The moon was near the full, but the air full of flying clouds,
and a strange hurricane of wind to add to the terror of the night; when,
looking on the back part of our camp, I thought I saw a creature within
our fortification, and so indeed he was, except his haunches, for he
had taken a running leap, I suppose, and with all his might had thrown
himself clear over our palisades, except one strong pile, which stood
higher than the rest, and which had caught hold of him, and by his
weight he had hanged himself upon it, the spike of the pile running into
his hinder haunch or thigh, on the inside; and by that he hung, growling
and biting the wood for rage"
309," by N. , and very
happily intercepted the heat of the sun all the after part of the day. 
The spot we pitched on had a little fresh water brook, or a stream
running into the creek by us; and we saw cattle feeding in the plains
and low ground east and to the south of us a great way"
310,"

However, he prevailed with us by his good words at last to stay but for
six months in the country, and then, if we did resolve to go, he would
submit; so at length we yielded to that, and he carried us about fifty
English miles south-east, where we found several rivulets of water,
which seemed to come all from a great ridge of mountains, which lay to
the north-east, and which, by our calculation, must be the beginning
that way of the great waste, which we had been forced northward to
avoid"
311," The Organic Act and the “instructions” from the State
Department commanded that a legislature should be elected at such-and-
such a time, and its sittings inaugurated at such-and-such a date.  It
was easy to get legislators, even at three dollars a day, although board
was four dollars and fifty cents, for distinction has its charm in
Nevada as well as elsewhere, and there were plenty of patriotic souls
out of employment; but to get a legislative hall for them to meet in was
another matter altogether"

“Will you let me kiss you?”

Seeing no scorn or repugnance in her face, the object of her charity

313," So Gridley stood there and shouted and perspired
till the sun went down; and when the crowd dispersed he had sold the
sack to three hundred different people, and had taken in eight thousand
dollars in gold"
314," Not having
understood the purport of his whisper, the little creature turned her
perfectly colourless face and deep dark eyes towards him; but without
loosening her hold in the least. 

The whisper was repeated"
315," Hardly anybody there, except the mild men,
stayed, or went away, without considering himself or herself neglected
and aggrieved by Mr Dombey or Mrs Dombey; and the speechless female in
the black velvet hat was found to have been stricken mute, because the
lady in the crimson velvet had been handed down before her"
316,"  There were scraps of
verse.   I do not profess to be a judge of such things, but they
appeared to me to be singularly wanting in merit.   There were also some
rather commonplace pictures of river scenery, a paint-box, a box of
colored chalks, some brushes, that curved bone which lies upon my
inkstand, a volume of Baxter's 'Moths and Butterflies,' a cheap
revolver, and a few cartridges"
317,"

The world was very busy and restless about him.  He became aware of that
again.  It was whispering and babbling.  It was never quiet.  This, and
the intricacy and complication of the footsteps, harassed him to death"
318,"

“My horse is perfectly quiet, I assure you,” said the gentleman. 

It was not that, but something in the gentleman himself—Florence could
not have said what—that made her recoil as if she had been stung"
319," It was a trouble to him to think of this face of
Florence. 

Because he felt any new compunction towards it? No.  Because the feeling
it awakened in him—of which he had had some old foreshadowing in older
times—was full-formed now, and spoke out plainly, moving him too much,
and threatening to grow too strong for his composure"
320,"  The dark indicate vegetable decay, while the others point to
clayey soil.   Twice we came across rapids, and in each case made a
portage of half a mile or so to avoid them.   The woods on either side
were primeval, which are more easily penetrated than woods of the
second growth, and we had no great difficulty in carrying our canoes
through them"
321," When we were
together, he asked me if I had a mind for an adventure that might make
amends for all past misfortunes.  I told him, yes, with all my heart; for
I did not care where I went, having nothing to lose, and no one to leave
behind me"

I said, impressively:

“Suffering stranger, proceed at your peril.  You see in me the melancholy
wreck of a once stalwart and magnificent manhood.  Spare me only just
this once, and tell me about young George Washington and his little
hatchet for a change"

""Well,"" said he, at last, ""we've gone and done it, young fellah my

“What’s his name, Captain Cuttle?” inquired Walter, determined to be

325,"  For a moment I thought it was
the lava-glow from some volcanic action; but this could not be so.   Any
volcanic action would surely be down in the hollow and not high among
the rocks.   What, then, was the alternative?  It was wonderful, and yet
it must surely be"
326," At last one of the negroes, by his order, laid forty
little stones one by another, to show us how many days we should travel,
and find provisions sufficient. 

Then I showed him our baggage, which was very heavy, particularly our
powder, shot, lead, iron, carpenters' tools, seamen's instruments, cases
of bottles, and other lumber"
327," And yet in his pride
and jealousy, he viewed with so much bitterness the thought of being
dependent for the very first step towards the accomplishment of his
soul’s desire, on a hired serving-woman who would be to the child, for
the time, all that even his alliance could have made his own wife, that
in every new rejection of a candidate he felt a secret pleasure"
328," We had, indeed, no great adventures happened
in this voyage, being out of the way of everything that could offer to
divert us; and as for seeing any vessel, we had not the least occasion
to hail anything in all the voyage; for we saw not one vessel, small
or great, the sea we were upon being entirely out of the way of all
commerce; for the people of Madagascar knew no more of the shores of
Africa than we did, only that there was a country of lions, as they call
it, that way"
329,"

D.  You are mistaken in them, I assure you; they would immediately come

your boat and ship and all on fire about your ears. 

W.  We will venture that if thou wilt come off"
330," But the pleasure
has outweighed the pain.  I know that, now, by knowing what I lose. ”

“Come in, Mr Carker, and make acquaintance with my good old Uncle,”
urged Walter.  “I have often talked to him about you, and he will be
glad to tell you all he hears from me"
331," John Jones had sold half his interest in
the “Bald Eagle and Mary Ann” for $65,000, gold coin, and gone to the
States for his family.  The widow Brewster had “struck it rich” in the
“Golden Fleece” and sold ten feet for $18,000—hadn’t money enough to buy
a crape bonnet when Sing-Sing Tommy killed her husband at Baldy
Johnson’s wake last spring"
332,"

At last, after a weary week, the day had come and the hour.   I ask you
to picture the shaded sitting-room of the Fazenda St.   Ignatio, two
miles inland from the town of Manaos.   Outside lay the yellow, brassy
glare of the sunshine, with the shadows of the palm trees as black and
definite as the trees themselves"
333," At you. 

_W_.  What occasion have we to value that?

_D_.  Why, he will send all his army down against you. 

_W_.  And what if they were all here just now? What dost thou suppose
they could do to us?

_D_"
334," When I read them over in the morning I felt
that I had found my legitimate occupation at last.  I reasoned within
myself that news, and stirring news, too, was what a paper needed, and I
felt that I was peculiarly endowed with the ability to furnish it"
335,"  Every instant I expected to feel his
grip upon my back.   And then suddenly there came a crash--I was falling
through space, and everything beyond was darkness and rest. 

As I emerged from my unconsciousness--which could not, I think, have
lasted more than a few minutes--I was aware of a most dreadful and
penetrating smell"
336," We jumped into the stage, the driver cracked his whip, and we
bowled away and left “the States” behind us.  It was a superb summer
morning, and all the landscape was brilliant with sunshine.  There was a
freshness and breeziness, too, and an exhilarating sense of emancipation
from all sorts of cares and responsibilities, that almost made us feel
that the years we had spent in the close, hot city, toiling and slaving,
had been wasted and thrown away"
337," He then shook Walter’s
hand again with a fervour that Walter was not slow to return and
started homeward. 

Mr Toots was accompanied by the Chicken, whom he had of late brought
with him every evening, and left in the shop, with an idea that
unforeseen circumstances might arise from without, in which the prowess
of that distinguished character would be of service to the Midshipman"
338,"

I had never had occasion to kill anybody, nor ever felt a desire to do
so, but had worn the thing in deference to popular sentiment, and in
order that I might not, by its absence, be offensively conspicuous, and
a subject of remark"
339," I knew it was not a rat this time,
and I thought it might be a centipede, because the Captain had killed
one on deck in the afternoon.  I turned out.  The first glance at the
pillow showed me repulsive sentinel perched upon each end of
it—cockroaches as large as peach leaves—fellows with long, quivering
antennae and fiery, malignant eyes"
340," A good deal better animal than he is was sold here day before
yesterday for a dollar and seventy-five cents, and sold again to-day for
two dollars and twenty-five cents; Williams bought a handsome and lively
little pony yesterday for ten dollars; and about the best common horse
on the island (and he is a really good one) sold yesterday, with Mexican
saddle and bridle, for seventy dollars—a horse which is well and widely
known, and greatly respected for his speed, good disposition and
everlasting bottom"
341," At the end of
this valley we met with a peopled country, and at first it put us to
some doubt whether we should go among them, or keep up towards the hills
northerly; and as our aim was principally as before, to make our way to
the river Niger, we inclined to the latter, pursuing our course by the
compass to the N"

""It's not a secret,"" she cried.   ""Do you suppose that the whole

Where is your dignity?  You, a man who should have been Regius

023b.  As the
trigger came back, the hammer would begin to rise and the barrel to turn
over, and presently down would drop the hammer, and away would speed the
ball.  To aim along the turning barrel and hit the thing aimed at was a
feat which was probably never done with an “Allen” in the world"
345," He did it during portions of
two nights, lying concealed one day and part of another, and for more
than forty hours suffering unimaginable anguish from hunger, thirst and
bodily pain.  The Indians robbed the coach of everything it contained,
including quite an amount of treasure"
346," Could you say it over once
more, and say it slow?”

“Well, to simplify it somewhat, was he, or rather had he ever been
connected with any organization sequestered from secular concerns and
devoted to self-sacrifice in the interests of morality?”

“All down but nine—set ’em up on the other alley, pard"
347," There was no danger about it; a sleeping man
_will_ seize the irons in time when the coach jolts.  These men were hard
worked, and it _was_ not possible for them to stay awake all the time. 

By and by we passed through Marysville, and over the Big Blue and Little
Sandy; thence about a mile, and entered Nebraska"
348," It’s
no fault of mine.  I am quite resigned.  I couldn’t stay my month or I
could never leave you then my darling and I must at last as well as at
first, don’t speak to me Miss Floy, for though I’m pretty firm I’m not
a marble doorpost, my own dear"
349," At parting, he assured her that he would
stand by Sol Gills, close and true; and once again inquired of Susan
Nipper, unable to forget her gallant words in reference to Mrs
MacStinger, “Would you, do you think my dear, though?”

When the desolate house had closed upon the two, the Captain’s thoughts
reverted to the old Instrument-maker, and he felt uncomfortable"
350," Then he asked me what trade I was.  'Trade?' says I; 'I am a
thief, a rogue, by my calling: I am a pirate and a murderer, and ought
to be hanged. ' 'Ay, ay,' says the devil, 'so you do; and you are the
man I looked for, and therefore come along with me"
351," Higbie’s
brawny muscles gave the boat good speed, but by the time we reached our
destination we judged that we had pulled nearer fifteen miles than
twelve. 

We landed on the big island and went ashore"
352,"  But I understand evidence when I see it,
and this should be good enough for anyone. ""

The Professor purred with satisfaction. 

""And then, sir, what did you do next?""

""It was the wet season, Mr.  Malone, and my stores were exhausted"
353,"
I warrant you,"" says I, ""you begin to hanker after home. ""

""Why, truly,"" says William, ""thou hast said it, and so I hope thou dost
too.  It is natural for most men that are abroad to desire to come home
again at last, especially when they are grown rich, and when they are
(as thou ownest thyself to be) rich enough, and so rich as they know not
what to do with more if they had it"
354,"  Now and then great shadows
loomed up for an instant and were gone--great, silent shadows which
seemed to prowl upon padded feet.   I was
exceedingly dry, so I lay down and took a long draught of its waters,
which were fresh and cold"
355," You are not made uneasy
by the supposition that young what’s-his-name was lost in bad weather
that was got up against him in these offices—are you? Fie, Captain!
Sleep, and soda-water, are the best cures for such uneasiness as that"
356," A.  Slade was himself, we have been informed, a Vigilante; he openly
boasted of it, and said he knew all that they knew.  He was never
accused, or even suspected, of either murder or robbery, committed in
this Territory (the latter crime was never laid to his charge, in any
place); but that he had killed several men in other localities was
notorious, and his bad reputation in this respect was a most powerful
argument in determining his fate, when he was finally arrested for the
offence above mentioned"
357,"""

The Professor snorted like an angry buffalo.   ""You really touch the
limit,"" said he.   ""You enlarge my view of the possible.   Cerebral
paresis!  Mental inertia!  Wonderful!""

He was too absurd to make me angry"

The reply was not bad: “Oh, yes—yes—my brother all same—we twins!”

A friend of mine, J.  Smith, hired a horse yesterday, the Kanaka

Smith had a saddle and blanket of his own, and he ordered the Kanaka to

359,"  I venture to trust that we may have some future
opportunity for the closer study of the carnivorous dinosaurs. ""

""And I venture to trust we may not,"" I observed. 

The Professor only raised his great eyebrows, as the schoolmaster meets
the irrelevant observation of the naughty boy"
360,"

As for myself, I must confess my eyes were open to my danger, though not
the least to anything of application for remedy.  I was all amazement and
confusion, and this was the first time that I can say I began to feel
the effects of that horror which I know since much more of, upon the
just reflection on my former life"
361," Goodman
went away for a week and left me the post of chief editor.  It destroyed
me.  The first day, I wrote my “leader” in the forenoon.  The second day,
I had no subject and put it off till the afternoon"
362," The moment I paused, he said:

“_Beg_ your pardon, sir, beg your pardon, but it can only be considered
remarkable when brought into strong outline by isolation.  Sir,
contrasted with a circumstance which occurred in my own experience, it
instantly becomes commonplace"
363," With a
single companion he rode to a ranch, the owners of which he suspected,
and opening the door, commenced firing, killing three, and wounding the
fourth. 

From a bloodthirstily interesting little Montana book"
364,"

This was not quite the last of Doctor Blimber’s, however.  There was
something else.  There was Mr Toots.  Who, unexpectedly letting down one
of the coach-windows, and looking in, said, with a most egregious
chuckle, “Is Dombey there?” and immediately put it up again, without
waiting for an answer"
365,"  Let me see; you have given me your
promise that my confidence will be respected?  That confidence, I may
say, will be far from complete.   But I am prepared to give you a few
indications which will be of interest"
366," The first dispute was, whither we
should go.  My comrade, as I called him now, that is to say, he that was
my captain before we took this Portuguese man-of-war, was for going to
the South Seas, and coasting up the west side of America, where we could
not fail of making several good prizes upon the Spaniards; and that
then, if occasion required it, we might come home by the South Seas to
the East Indies, and so go round the globe, as others had done before
us"
367,"” Slade started and took a long look, with his dark and
piercing eyes, at the gentleman.  It seems
probable that the intimation of personal danger he had received had not
been forgotten entirely; though fatally for him, he took a foolish way
of showing his remembrance of it"
368,"  It was
the last conscious movement he was to make upon earth.   Lord John's
rifle cracked, and the king sank down, a tangled red sprawling thing,
upon the ground. 

""Shoot into the thick of them!  Shoot! sonny, shoot!"" cried my
companion"
369," One of
the negroes understood me presently, and beckoned to me to come upon the
deck, where, taking my fuzee, which I never let go out of my hand for
some time after we had mastered the ship--I say, offering to take hold
of it, he made the proper motion of throwing it into the sea; by which
I understood, as I did afterwards, that they had thrown all the
small-arms, powder, shot, swords, &c"
370,"





CHAPTER XXVIII. 


After leaving the Sink, we traveled along the Humboldt river a little
way.  People accustomed to the monster mile-wide Mississippi, grow
accustomed to associating the term “river” with a high degree of watery
grandeur"
371," The stamps on the
deed, which is now on its way to Humboldt County, from New York, for
record, amounted to $3,000, which is said to be the largest amount of
stamps ever placed on one document.  A working capital of $1,000,000 has
been paid into the treasury, and machinery has already been purchased
for a large quartz mill, which will be put up as soon as possible"
372," Before the Spanish caved in, some of
their twelve-inch horizontal timbers were compressed in this way until
they were only five inches thick! Imagine the power it must take to
squeeze a solid log together in that way"
373,"—On Tuesday night, a German named Charles
Hurtzal, engineer in a mill at Silver City, came to this place, and
visited the hurdy-gurdy house on B street.  The music, dancing and
Teutonic maidens awakened memories of Faderland until our German friend
was carried away with rapture"
374," In another moment, he was remembering how few such cases
seemed to have ever happened.  In another moment he was wondering
whether they ever happened and were not found out. 

As his unusual emotion subsided, these misgivings gradually melted
away, though so much of their shadow remained behind, that he was
constant in his resolution to look closely after Richards himself,
without appearing to do so"
375,"

“And so Dombey and Son, as I observed upon a certain sad occasion,”
said Miss Tox, winding up a host of recollections, “is indeed a
daughter, Polly, after all. ”

“And a good one!” exclaimed Polly. 

“You are right,” said Miss Tox; “and it’s a credit to you, Polly, that
you were always her friend when she was a little child"
376,"  We all sat in amazed silence round the fire, like the heroes
of Virgil when the Harpies came down upon them.   It was Summerlee who
was the first to speak. 

""Professor Challenger,"" said he, in a solemn voice, which quavered with
emotion, ""I owe you an apology"
377,"  Inwardly I am filled with apprehension. 

Let me give you, with as much detail as I can, the sequence of events
which have led us to this catastrophe. 

When I finished my last letter I stated that we were within seven miles
from an enormous line of ruddy cliffs, which encircled, beyond all
doubt, the plateau of which Professor Challenger spoke"
378,"

We made no stay here, but put to sea again, N. W.  by N. , but had little
wind for a fortnight more, when we made land again; and standing in with
the shore, we were surprised to find ourselves on the south shore of
Java; and just as we were coming to an anchor we saw a boat, carrying
Dutch colours, sailing along-shore"
379,"  Birds were calling among the
foliage--especially one with a peculiar whooping cry which was new to
us--but beyond these sounds there were no signs of life. 

Our first care was to make some sort of list of our own stores, so that
we might know what we had to rely upon"

""But what made him draw such an animal?""

""Trade gin, I should think. ""

""Oh, that's the best explanation you can give, is it?""

""Well, sir, what is yours?""

""The obvious one that the creature exists"
381,"  But who--who in all this wide
world could ever have imagined the incredible shape which that deed was
to take, or the strange steps by which I was led to the doing of it?

And, after all, this opening chapter will seem to the reader to have
nothing to do with my narrative; and yet there would have been no
narrative without it, for it is only when a man goes out into the world
with the thought that there are heroisms all round him, and with the
desire all alive in his heart to follow any which may come within sight
of him, that he breaks away as I did from the life he knows, and
ventures forth into the wonderful mystic twilight land where lie the
great adventures and the great rewards"
382," We
were so tired that we slept soundly.

We were fifteen days making the trip—two hundred miles; thirteen,
rather, for we lay by a couple of days, in one place, to let the horses
rest"
383,"

We passed abundance of inhabitants upon this upper part of the river,
and with this observation, that almost every ten miles we came to a
separate nation, and every separate nation had a different speech,
or else their speech had differing dialects, so that they did not
understand one another"
384,"

Accordingly, our men went like a little army, and with mighty
preparations for an enterprise, the like of which has scarce been ever
heard, to form the siege of a great tree.  However, when they came there,
they found the task difficult enough, for the old trunk was indeed a
very great one, and very tall, being at least two-and-twenty feet high,
with seven old limbs standing out every way from the top, but decayed,
and very few leaves, if any, left on it"
385,"  You'll be there in any case, so you'll
just give us a pretty full report.   I'll keep space up to midnight. ""

My day was a busy one, and I had an early dinner at the Savage Club
with Tarp Henry, to whom I gave some account of my adventures"
386," They listened long, but
could hear no more; so they went on to the river-side, which was a very
fine fresh stream, but widened apace, and they kept on by the banks of
it, till, almost at once, it opened or widened into a good large creek
or harbour, about five miles from the sea; and that which was still more
surprising, as they marched forward, they plainly saw in the mouth of
the harbour, or creek, the wreck of a ship"
387,"  I don't think he makes any claims of
that kind.   But I do believe he has got something new. ""

""Then for Heaven's sake, man, write it up!""

""I'm longing to, but all I know he gave me in confidence and on
condition that I didn't"
388,"  He had
gone the length of faking some photographs over the South American
business. ""

""You say he is a faddist.   What is his particular fad?""

""He has a thousand, but the latest is something about Weissmann and
Evolution"

PREFACE OF 1867


I make so bold as to believe that the faculty (or the habit) of
correctly observing the characters of men, is a rare one.  I have not
even found, within my experience, that the faculty (or the habit) of
correctly observing so much as the faces of men, is a general one by
any means"

dingy portals of the famous aristocratic rookery"

""Be good, Jessie. ""

""A roaring, raging bully!""

""That's done it!  Stool of penance!"" said he. 

To my amazement he stooped, picked her up, and placed her sitting upon
a high pedestal of black marble in the angle of the hall"
392,"

The following verse (from Chapter IX.  of the Book of Nephi) appears to
contain information not familiar to everybody:

And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ascended into heaven, the
multitude did disperse, and every man did take his wife and his
children, and did return to his own home"
393,"  Why, the river rises and falls the best part
of forty feet, and half the country is a morass that you can't pass
over.   Why shouldn't somethin' new and wonderful lie in such a country?
And why shouldn't we be the men to find it out?  Besides,"" he added,
his queer, gaunt face shining with delight, ""there's a sportin' risk in
every mile of it"
394,"""

""Why, then,"" says William, ""he is a dead man; for if it were to save his
life, and the lives of all the crowd that is with him, he shall never
have one of us in his power.  But I'll tell thee,"" said William, ""how
thou shalt cheat him, and gain thy own liberty too, if thou hast any
mind to see thy own country again, and art not turned savage, and grown
fond of living all thy days among heathens and savages"
395," Ned,—nobody denies that,—but—”

“Then I’m _going to hang him_, that’s all.  Everybody I’ve talked to
talks just the same way you do.  Everybody says he killed the nigger,
everybody knows he killed the nigger, and yet every lubber of you wants
him _tried_ for it"
396," If you don’t object to our old
whim, Sir, let us devote this first glass to Walter and his wife. ”

“To Walter and his wife!” says Mr Dombey.  “Florence, my child”—and
turns to kiss her. 

“To Walter and his wife!” says Mr Toots"
397," Several gentlemen were sent for to
see him, in his last moments, one of whom (Judge Davis) made a short
address to the people; but in such low tones as to be inaudible, save to
a few in his immediate vicinity"
398," It is a fair, warm summer morning, and the
sun shines on them, as they walk towards the darkening mist that
overspreads the City.  Riches are uncovering in shops; jewels, gold, and
silver flash in the goldsmith’s sunny windows; and great houses cast a
stately shade upon them as they pass"
399,"


It did seem strange enough to see a town again after what appeared to us
such a long acquaintance with deep, still, almost lifeless and houseless
solitude! We tumbled out into the busy street feeling like meteoric
people crumbled off the corner of some other world, and wakened up
suddenly in this"
400,"

One evening we were very much surprised.  We were most of us laid down
on our mats to sleep, when our watch came running in among us, being
frighted with the sudden roaring of some lions just by them, which, it
seems, they had not seen, the night being dark, till they were just upon
them"
401,"

Upon this, we went back to the hill, and fell to work with that.  We
found the earth loose, and of a yellowish loamy colour, and in some
places a white hard kind of stone, which, in describing since to some
of our artists, they tell me was the spar which is found by ore, and
surrounds it in the mine"
402,"  The next instant
it was gone--and so was our dinner.   A huge black shadow, twenty feet
across, skimmed up into the air; for an instant the monster wings
blotted out the stars, and then it vanished over the brow of the cliff
above us"
403," But there it ended, for Solomon Gills
himself (more generally called old Sol) was far from having a maritime
appearance.  To say nothing of his Welsh wig, which was as plain and
stubborn a Welsh wig as ever was worn, and in which he looked like
anything but a Rover, he was a slow, quiet-spoken, thoughtful old
fellow, with eyes as red as if they had been small suns looking at you
through a fog; and a newly-awakened manner, such as he might have
acquired by having stared for three or four days successively through
every optical instrument in his shop, and suddenly came back to the
world again, to find it green"
404," However, we called a general council to see what
money we had, and to bring it all together, that it might go as far as
possible; and when it came to my turn, I pulled out a moidore and the
two dollars I spoke of before"
405," Somewhere, anywhere, to hide
her head! somewhere, anywhere, for refuge, never more to look upon the
place from which she fled!

But there were people going to and fro; there were opening shops, and
servants at the doors of houses; there was the rising clash and roar of
the day’s struggle"
406," He took out his tobacco-box and
pipe, and composing himself to smoke, looked for it in the red glow
from the bowl, and in the wreaths of vapour that curled upward from his
lips; but there was not so much as an atom of the rust of Hope’s anchor
in either"
407,"

""First of all, as to your return to my house after your most
justifiable expulsion""--he protruded his beard, and stared at me as one
who challenges and invites contradiction--""after, as I say, your
well-merited expulsion"
408,"  This explanation of
deficiencies or abnormalities you will kindly accept.   There was talk
of faking.   I am not in a mood to argue such a point. ""

The photograph was certainly very off-colored.   An unkind critic might
easily have misinterpreted that dim surface"
409,"  It is a natural protection to this
singular country. ""

""Did you see any other trace of life?""

""No, sir, I did not; but during the week that we lay encamped at the
base of the cliff we heard some very strange noises from above"
410,"

It was in the early afternoon that we started upon our journey.   The
young chief walked at our head as our guide, but refused indignantly to
carry any burden.   Behind him came the two surviving Indians with our
scanty possessions upon their backs"
411,"
It had its part, perhaps, in saving her curls; for Mrs Brown, after
hovering about her with the scissors for some moments, like a new kind
of butterfly, bade her hide them under the bonnet and let no trace of
them escape to tempt her"
412,"  At one point was an
isolated pyramidal rock, crowned by a great tree, which appeared to be
separated by a cleft from the main crag.   Behind it all, a blue
tropical sky.   A thin green line of vegetation fringed the summit of
the ruddy cliff"
413,"  He turned it over.   Again it was blank. 
We looked at each other in a bewildered silence, which was broken by a
discordant burst of derisive laughter from Professor Summerlee. 

""It is an open admission,"" he cried"
414," They promised that they would
create a court composed of captains of the best character; they would
empanel a jury; they would conduct everything in a way becoming the
serious nature of the business in hand, and give the case an impartial
hearing and the accused a fair trial"
415,"  But at last the poison
worked.   One of them gave a deep rumbling groan and dropped his huge
squat head on to the earth.   The other bounded round in an eccentric
circle with shrill, wailing cries, and then lying down writhed in agony
for some minutes before it also stiffened and lay still"
416," ""Now,"" says he,
""I think we may begin to work;"" so he divided our negroes into couples
and set them to work, to search and wash the sand and ooze in the bottom
of the water where it was not deep. 

In the first day and a quarter our men all together had gathered a pound
and two ounces of gold or thereabouts, and as we found the quantity
increased the farther we went, we followed it about three days, till
another small rivulet joined the first, and then searching up the
stream, we found gold there too; so we pitched our camp in the angle
where the rivers joined, and we diverted ourselves, as I may call it,
in washing the gold out of the sand of the river, and in getting
provisions"
417,"  The contents were
as follows:--


                              ""ENMORE PARK, W. 

""SIR,--I have duly received your note, in which you claim to endorse my
views, although I am not aware that they are dependent upon endorsement
either from you or anyone else"
418," It is mere ceremony, for it does not
enlighten the customer much.

Their price for washing was $2. 50 per dozen—rather cheaper than white
people could afford to wash for at that time"
419," ""Nay, that's true,"" says I
again; ""we cannot be sure. "" ""Yes, friend,"" says he, ""I think we may be
sure that we are running away from her, not chasing her.  I am afraid,""
adds he, ""thou art turned Quaker, and hast resolved not to use the hand
of power, or art a coward, and art flying from thy enemy"
420," Often we felt our chairs jar, and heard the faint boom of a
blast down in the bowels of the earth under the office. 

The mountain side was so steep that the entire town had a slant to it
like a roof"
421,"  They have short, bandy legs, you see, and heavy
bodies.   Even Challenger could give a few yards in a hundred to the
best of them, and you or I would be a perfect Shrubb.   Another point
was that they knew nothin' about guns"
422,"

The openings were about eighty feet above the ground, and were led up
to by long stone stairs, so narrow and steep that no large animal could
mount them.   Inside they were warm and dry, running in straight
passages of varying length into the side of the hill, with smooth gray
walls decorated with many excellent pictures done with charred sticks
and representing the various animals of the plateau"
423," But let us get out of
this hellish condition we are in first. ""

""Nay,"" says William, ""thou art in the right there; we must never talk of
repenting while we continue pirates. ""

""Well,"" says I, ""William, that's what I meant; for if we must not
reform, as well as be sorry for what is done, I have no notion what
repentance means; indeed, at best I know little of the matter; but the
nature of the thing seems to tell me that the first step we have to take
is to break off this wretched course; and I'll begin there with you,
with all my heart"
424,"
Lord John Roxton steps briskly, and his thin, eager face beams forth
between his hunting-cap and his muffler.   As for myself, I am glad to
have got the bustling days of preparation and the pangs of leave-taking
behind me, and I have no doubt that I show it in my bearing"
425," Let
him try to forgive me mine!”

“Oh Mama!” said Florence.  “How it lightens my heart, even in such a
strange meeting and parting, to hear this!”

“Strange words in my own ears,” said Edith, “and foreign to the sound
of my own voice! But even if I had been the wretched creature I have
given him occasion to believe me, I think I could have said them still,
hearing that you and he were very dear to one another"
426,"

Mr Carker was quick to do so, and Walter was quick to return. 

“Gay,” said Mr Dombey, turning a little to look at him over his
shoulder.  “Here is a—”

“An opening,” said Mr Carker, with his mouth stretched to the utmost"
427,"  I invite you to be present at the exhibition. ""  He
handed me a card from his desk.   ""You will perceive that Mr.  Percival
Waldron, a naturalist of some popular repute, is announced to lecture
at eight-thirty at the Zoological Institute's Hall upon 'The Record of

428,"

""Thou hast dealt friendly by me,"" says he, ""and I will be plain with
thee, whether I came willingly to thee or not.  I shall make myself
as useful to thee as I can, but thou knowest it is not my business to
meddle when thou art to fight"

“There’s a wedding just on, Sir,” said the beadle, “but it’ll be over
directly, if you’ll walk into the westry here. ”

Before he turned again to lead the way, he gave Mr Dombey a bow and a
half smile of recognition, importing that he (the beadle) remembered to
have had the pleasure of attending on him when he buried his wife, and
hoped he had enjoyed himself since"
430,"

I was greatly mortified at this news, and could no longer withstand the
importunities of the men to return to Madagascar.  However, as the wind
continued still to blow at S. S. E.  by S.  The ship
was of Bengal, belonging to the Great Mogul's country, but had on board
a Dutch pilot, whose name, if I remember right, was Vandergest, and
several European seamen, whereof three were English"
431," We fired a gun, upon her
nearer approach, to bring her to an anchor, but immediately she fired
five guns by way of salute, and spread her English ancient.  Then we
began to guess it was friend William, but wondered what was the meaning
of his being in a sloop, whereas we sent him away in a ship of near 300
tons; but he soon let us into the whole history of his management, with
which we had a great deal of reason to be very well satisfied"
432,"  There was a broad pathway with many tracks
upon it at the spot which I had found, so that it was clearly one of
the drinking-places of the animals.   Close to the water's edge there
was a huge isolated block of lava"
433,"
In the meantime the native soldiers privately surrounded him and the
seven men he had with him, and seizing them, carried them to meet the
dissauva, bearing the captain on a hammock on their shoulders"
434,"  As the huge brute loped along it dropped
forward upon its fore-paws and brought its nose to the ground every
twenty yards or so.   It was smelling out my trail.   Sometimes, for an
instant, it was at fault"
435," But he was always a general in
administrative ability, and a bull-dog in courage and
determination—otherwise the chieftainship over the lawless underlings of
the overland service would never in any instance have been to him
anything but an equivalent for a month of insolence and distress and a
bullet and a coffin at the end of it"
436,"  It
was the stegosaurus--the very creature which Maple White had preserved
in his sketch-book, and which had been the first object which arrested
the attention of Challenger!  There he was--perhaps the very specimen
which the American artist had encountered"
437,"

“Woman,” said Mr Dombey to the old witch who was chuckling and leering
close at his elbow, and who, when he turned to address her, pointed
stealthily at her daughter, and rubbed her hands, and pointed again,
“Woman! I believe that I am weak and forgetful of my station in coming
here, but you know why I come, and what you offered when you stopped me
in the street the other day"

Next in rank and importance to the division-agent came the “conductor. ”
His beat was the same length as the agent’s—two hundred and fifty miles. 
He sat with the driver, and (when necessary) rode that fearful distance,

This frighted me out of my wits, for I had nobody to vouch for me what I

bear witness that I was not a Turk"

On the third day it became evident that our journey in the canoes could
not last much longer, for the stream was rapidly growing more shallow. 
Twice in as many hours we stuck upon the bottom.   Finally we pulled the
boats up among the brushwood and spent the night on the bank of the
river"
445," A member proposed to save three dollars a day to the nation by
dispensing with the Chaplain.  And yet that short-sighted man needed the
Chaplain more than any other member, perhaps, for he generally sat with
his feet on his desk, eating raw turnips, during the morning prayer"
446," Thou art a deceitful rogue thyself, for it is plain thou knowest
these people would only persuade us on shore to entrap and surprise us;
and yet thou that art a Christian, as thou callest thyself, would have
us come on shore and put our lives into their hands who know nothing
that belongs to compassion, good usage, or good manners"
447,"

I should, indeed, have observed, that we went, some days before we
parted, to a small sandy island close under the shore, where there was
a good cove of deep water, like a road, and out of sight of any of the
factories, which are here very thick upon the coast"
448,"

Mrs Wickam put her own construction on Paul’s eccentricities; and being
confirmed in her low spirits by a perplexed view of chimneys from the
room where she was accustomed to sit, and by the noise of the wind, and
by the general dulness (gashliness was Mrs Wickam’s strong expression)
of her present life, deduced the most dismal reflections from the
foregoing premises"
449,"

“We have no Faith left, positively,” said Mrs Skewton, advancing her
shrivelled ear; for Mr Dombey was saying something to Edith.  “We have
no Faith in the dear old Barons, who were the most delightful
creatures—or in the dear old Priests, who were the most warlike of
men—or even in the days of that inestimable Queen Bess, upon the wall
there, which were so extremely golden"
450," Our fellow-passenger, Bemis, took care of
himself, during this part of the evening, and did not make an
overpowering success of it, either, for he came into our room in the
hotel about eleven o’clock, full of cheerfulness, and talking loosely,
disjointedly and indiscriminately, and every now and then tugging out a
ragged word by the roots that had more hiccups than syllables in it"
451," But in
the night the pup would get stretchy and brace his feet against the old
man’s back and shove, grunting complacently the while; and now and then,
being warm and snug, grateful and happy, he would paw the old man’s back
simply in excess of comfort; and at yet other times he would dream of
the chase and in his sleep tug at the old man’s back hair and bark in
his ear"

his guidance and follow on to the westward. ""

We had proceeded some five more miles when again we saw a white arrow
upon the rocks.   It was at a point where the face of the cliff was for

“Do you know a friend of Mr Gills, called Captain Cuttle?” inquired
Florence, after a moment’s reflection. 

“Him with a hook, Miss?” rejoined Rob, with an illustrative twist of
his left hand.  Yes, Miss"
454," On the other
hand, he assured us, and showed us a map of it, that, if we went
northward, the western shore of Africa went out into the sea above
1000 miles west, so that we should have so much and more land to travel
afterwards; which land might, for aught we knew, be as wild, barren,
and desert as this"
455," It made a horrible clutter among them, and in
general they all took to their heels, only that we could observe that
some walked off with more gravity and majesty than others, being not
so much frighted at the noise and fire; and we could perceive that some
were left upon the ground struggling as for life, but we durst not stir
out to see what they were"
456,"

I was now to enter upon a part of independent life, a thing I was indeed
very ill prepared to manage, for I was perfectly loose and dissolute
in my behaviour, bold and wicked while I was under government, and now
perfectly unfit to be trusted with liberty, for I was as ripe for any
villainy as a young fellow that had no solid thought ever placed in his
mind could be supposed to be"
457,"  Another and another followed.   At the same instant I heard
the crash of Lord John's elephant-gun, and, looking up, saw one of the
creatures with a broken wing struggling upon the ground, spitting and
gurgling at us with a wide-opened beak and blood-shot, goggled eyes,
like some devil in a medieval picture"
458,"  Is that clear?""

""It is very hard,"" said I.  ""Surely a judicious account----""

He replaced the notebook upon the table. 

""That ends it,"" said he.   ""I wish you a very good morning. ""

""No, no!"" I cried"

From Virginia’s airy situation one could look over a vast, far-reaching
panorama of mountain ranges and deserts; and whether the day was bright
or overcast, whether the sun was rising or setting, or flaming in the
zenith, or whether night and the moon held sway, the spectacle was
always impressive and beautiful"
460,"

""The colliery explosion was excellent.   So was the Southwark fire.   You
have the true descreeptive touch.   What did you want to see me about?""

""To ask a favor. ""

He looked alarmed, and his eyes shunned mine"
461,"  There was no
sign of the monster, however, nor could I hear any sound from above.   I
began to walk slowly round, therefore, feeling in every direction to
find out what this strange place could be into which I had been so
opportunely precipitated"
462,"  It had already a
strong, natural tilt in the direction of the plateau, so that the
matter was not difficult.   Finally I set to work in earnest upon the
trunk, taking turn and turn with Lord John.   In a little over an hour
there was a loud crack, the tree swayed forward, and then crashed over,
burying its branches among the bushes on the farther side"
463," So we advanced; but we were surprised
when, being not quite come to the top, one of our company, who, with two
negroes, was got up before us, cried out, ""The sea! the sea!"" and fell
a-dancing and jumping, as signs of joy"
464," ""Well, then,"" said the
gunner, who spoke good English, ""you shall be called Captain Bob;"" and
so they gave me my title ever after. 

Nothing is more certain of the Portuguese than this, take them
nationally or personally, if they are animated and heartened up by
anybody to go before, and encourage them by example, they will behave
well enough; but if they have nothing but their own measures to follow,
they sink immediately: these men had certainly fled from a parcel of
naked savages, though even by flying they could not have saved their
lives, if I had not shouted and hallooed, and rather made sport with the
thing than a fight, to keep up their courage"
465," But he was indisposed, and being to leeward, excused his
coming, but left it all to me; but before my boat was returned, Captain
Wilmot called to me by his speaking-trumpet, which all the men might
hear as well as I; thus, calling me by my name, ""I hear they are honest
fellows; pray tell them they are all welcome, and make them a bowl of
punch"
466,"

A pause.  Then:

“_Are_ you going to hand out your money or _not_?”

I dropped my hands to my pockets and said:

Certainly! I—”

“Put up your hands! Do you want your head blown off? Higher!”

I put them above my head again"
467,"
A Separation


With the day, though not so early as the sun, uprose Miss Susan Nipper. 
There was a heaviness in this young maiden’s exceedingly sharp black
eyes, that abated somewhat of their sparkling, and suggested—which was
not their usual character—the possibility of their being sometimes
shut"
468,"

We presently found their business, and that they desired to go with us;
and as for their arms, they desired we would send men on board the boat,
and that they would deliver them all to us, which was done"
469,"

In this manner the river carried us up, by our computation, near 200
miles, and then it narrowed apace, and was not above as broad as the
Thames is at Windsor, or thereabouts; and, after another day, we came
to a great waterfall or cataract, enough to fright us, for I believe the
whole body of water fell at once perpendicularly down a precipice
above sixty foot high, which made noise enough to deprive men of their
hearing, and we heard it above ten miles before we came to it"
470," I trust you had a good season.  How
much oil”—

“Oil? What do you take me for? I’m not a whaler. ”

“Oh, I beg a thousand pardons, your Excellency. 

“Major General in the household troops, no doubt? Minister of the
Interior, likely? Secretary of war? First Gentleman of the Bed-chamber?
Commissioner of the Royal”—

“Stuff! I’m no official"
471,"

Mr Carker, quick of eye, steady of hand, and a good horseman, was
afoot, and had the struggling animal upon his legs and by the bridle,
in a moment.  Otherwise that morning’s confidence would have been Mr
Dombey’s last"
472," Not always and
unvaryingly, but about one hundred and forty-three months out of twelve
years, perhaps.  Flowers bloom there, always, the reader can easily
believe—people suffer and sweat, and swear, morning, noon and night, and
wear out their stanchest energies fanning themselves"
473,"
However, for the present we resolved to appoint this for our place of
rendezvous, and go and look out.  This was about the latter end of April. 

Accordingly we put to sea, and cruised away to the northward, for the
Arabian coast"

In place of roughs and rowdies staring and blackguarding on the corners,
I saw long-haired, saddle-colored Sandwich Island maidens sitting on the
ground in the shade of corner houses, gazing indolently at whatever or
whoever happened along; instead of wretched cobble-stone pavements, I
walked on a firm foundation of coral, built up from the bottom of the
sea by the absurd but persevering insect of that name, with a light
layer of lava and cinders overlying the coral, belched up out of
fathomless perdition long ago through the seared and blackened crater
that stands dead and harmless in the distance now; instead of cramped
and crowded street-cars, I met dusky native women sweeping by, free as
the wind, on fleet horses and astride, with gaudy riding-sashes,
streaming like banners behind them; instead of the combined stenches of
Chinadom and Brannan street slaughter-houses, I breathed the balmy
fragrance of jessamine, oleander, and the Pride of India; in place of
the hurry and bustle and noisy confusion of San Francisco, I moved in
the midst of a Summer calm as tranquil as dawn in the Garden of Eden; in
place of the Golden City’s skirting sand hills and the placid bay, I saw
on the one side a frame-work of tall, precipitous mountains close at
hand, clad in refreshing green, and cleft by deep, cool, chasm-like
valleys—and in front the grand sweep of the ocean: a brilliant,
transparent green near the shore, bound and bordered by a long white
line of foamy spray dashing against the reef, and further out the dead
blue water of the deep sea, flecked with “white caps,” and in the far
horizon a single, lonely sail—a mere accent-mark to emphasize a
slumberous calm and a solitude that were without sound or limit"
475,"

The mules, under violent swearing, coaxing and whip-cracking, would make
at stated intervals a “spurt,” and drag the coach a hundred or may be
two hundred yards, stirring up a billowy cloud of dust that rolled back,
enveloping the vehicle to the wheel-tops or higher, and making it seem
afloat in a fog"
476,"

“No, no.  There’s nothing the matter, said Mr Brogley.  “Don’t let it put
you out of the way. ”

Walter looked from the broker to his Uncle in mute amazement. 

“The fact is,” said Mr Brogley, “there’s a little payment on a bond
debt —three hundred and seventy odd, overdue: and I’m in possession"
477,"

“I know it’s very weak and silly of me,” she repeated, “to be so
trembly and shaky from head to foot, and to allow my feelings so
completely to get the better of me, but I cannot help it.  I thought I
should have fallen out of the staircase window as I came down from
seeing dear Fanny, and that tiddy ickle sing"
478,"""

""Dear me!""  His black moustache lifted and a white fang twinkled in a
sneer.   ""You won't stand it, eh?""

""Don't be such a fool, Professor!"" I cried.   ""What can you hope for?
I'm fifteen stone, as hard as nails, and play center three-quarter
every Saturday for the London Irish"
479," And let us go without one hard feeling
towards each other.  Let us forget and forgive bygones.  I know that you
have felt hard towards me for turning over the canoe, and for knowing
too much and leading you round and round in the snow—but I meant well;
forgive me"
480,"”

“No, _sir_.  I’ll excuse you. ”

“Just as you say. ”

A saloon-keeper’s boy passed by with a steaming pitcher of hot punch,
and Boggs snuffed the fragrance gratefully.  He gazed fondly after the
boy and saw him start up the _Enterprise_ stairs"
481,"

""At last!"" he cried; ""at last!""

I gazed anxiously at him, with a vague expectation that some terrible
fate would dart at him from the curtain of green behind him.   But all
was quiet, save that a strange, many-colored bird flew up from under
his feet and vanished among the trees"
482,"""

""Invisible ink!"" I suggested. 

""I don't think!"" said Lord Roxton, holding the paper to the light. 
""No, young fellah my lad, there is no use deceiving yourself.   I'll go
bail for it that nothing has ever been written upon this paper"
483,"  ""Me stay here.   No
fear.   You always find me when you want. ""

His honest black face, and the immense view before us, which carried us
half-way back to the affluent of the Amazon, helped us to remember that
we really were upon this earth in the twentieth century, and had not by
some magic been conveyed to some raw planet in its earliest and wildest
state"
484,"”

“Brother, don’t speak like this.  If you have any special reason, as you
say you have, and think you have—though I say, No!—to love me, spare me
the hearing of such wild mad words!”

He covered his face with both his hands; but soon permitted her, coming
near him, to take one in her own"
485," Finally he took it up, and went away, fondling it in his pocket. 
He idled through unfrequented streets, stopping in doorways and corners
to take it out and look at it.  By and by he went home to his lodgings—an
empty queens-ware hogshead,—and employed himself till night trying to
make up his mind what to buy with it"

The coffee ran out.  At least it was reduced to one tin-cupful, and Slade
was about to take it when he saw that my cup was empty. 

He politely offered to fill it, but although I wanted it, I politely
declined"
487," “I have told you so. ”

“Not by me,” returned his brother.  “By your informant, if you have one. 
If not, by your own thoughts and suspicions. ”

“I have no suspicions,” said the Manager.  “Mine are certainties"
488,"
The stranger smiled, smoothed out the hat, and offered it to Brown with
profuse apologies couched in caustic sarcasm, and begged Brown not to
destroy him.  Brown threw off his coat and challenged the man to
fight—abused him, threatened him, impeached his courage, and urged and
even implored him to fight; and in the meantime the smiling stranger
placed himself under our protection in mock distress"
489," At last,
when he came to, he turned away and said, as one who communes with
himself upon a matter too vast to grasp:

“_Coffee_! Well, if that don’t go clean ahead of me, I’m d—-d!”

We could not eat, and there was no conversation among the hostlers and
herdsmen—we all sat at the same board"
490,"

After all our hard travel, here we were on the bank of the stream again,
with the inn beyond dimly outlined through the driving snow-fall.  While
we were considering what to do, the young Swede landed from the canoe
and took his pedestrian way Carson-wards, singing his same tiresome song
about his “sister and his brother” and “the child in the grave with its
mother,” and in a short minute faded and disappeared in the white
oblivion"
491,"
She shall not, while I can interpose, be tampered with and tainted by
the lessons I have learned.  This is no hard condition on this bitter
night. ”

“If you had proposed it in a filial manner, Edith,” whined her mother,
“perhaps not; very likely not"
492,"

And what are the young couple saying as they leave the church, and go
out at the gate?

“Dear Walter, thank you! I can go away, now, happy. ”

“And when we come back, Florence, we will come and see his grave
again"
493,"

_D_.  You put a thought in my head that I will speak to you about
to-morrow. 

It was our good fortune to get our ship off that very night, and to
bring her to an anchor at about a mile and a half farther out, and in
deep water, to our great satisfaction; so that we had no need to fear
the Dutchman's king, with his hundred thousand men; and indeed we
had some sport with them the next day, when they came down, a
vast prodigious multitude of them, very few less in number, in our
imagination, than a hundred thousand, with some elephants; though, if it
had been an army of elephants, they could have done us no harm; for we
were fairly at our anchor now, and out of their reach"
494,"

Again, Florence, in pursuit of her strong purpose with reference to her
father, and her steady resolution to believe that she was herself
unwittingly to blame for their so cold and distant relations, would
recall to mind that this gentleman was his confidential friend, and
would think, with an anxious heart, could her struggling tendency to
dislike and fear him be a part of that misfortune in her, which had
turned her father’s love adrift, and left her so alone? She dreaded
that it might be; sometimes believed it was: then she resolved that she
would try to conquer this wrong feeling; persuaded herself that she was
honoured and encouraged by the notice of her father’s friend; and hoped
that patient observation of him and trust in him would lead her
bleeding feet along that stony road which ended in her father’s heart"
495,"

We took this advantage, and stood away for Carthagena, and from thence
with great difficulty beat it up at a distance from under the shore for
St.  Martha, till we came to the Dutch island of Curacoa, and from thence
to the island of Tobago, which, as before, was our rendezvous; which,
being a deserted, uninhabited island, we at the same time made use of
for a retreat"
496,"
Let me hear if thou canst propose to me anything beyond it. ""

""Certainly, friend,"" says William, very gravely, ""there is something
beyond it;"" and lifting up his hands, he seemed very much affected, and
I thought I saw tears stand in his eyes; but I, that was too hardened
a wretch to be moved with these things, laughed at him"
497,"
It drifted, and continued to drift, but at the same safe distance from
land, and we walked along abreast it and waited for fortune to favor us. 
At the end of an hour it approached a jutting cape, and Higbie ran ahead
and posted himself on the utmost verge and prepared for the assault"
498,"  For a moment I was shocked at the thought that some
sudden danger might have befallen them.   But then a simpler and more
natural explanation came to my mind.   It was now broad daylight.   No
doubt my absence had been noticed"
499," Then
another pointed to the surgeon, and at last we found it out, that the
meaning was, that he should heal the prince's father too, who was dead,
being shot through the head, as above. 

We presently took the hint, and would not say we could not do it, but
let them know, the men that were killed were those that had first fallen
upon us, and provoked us, and we would by no means make them alive
again; and that, if any others did so, we would kill them too, and never
let them live any more: but that, if he (the prince) would be willing
to go with us, and do as we should direct him, we would not let him die,
and would make his arm well"
500,"

Ever since the mysterious visit which had been paid to our camp we
always returned to it with some misgivings.   However, on this occasion
we found everything in order. 

That evening we had a grand discussion upon our present situation and
future plans, which I must describe at some length, as it led to a new
departure by which we were enabled to gain a more complete knowledge of
Maple White Land than might have come in many weeks of exploring"
501,"

[I do not desire to strain the reader’s fancy, hurtfully, and yet it
would be a favor to me if he would try to fancy this lamb in battle, or
the duelling ground or at the head of a vigilance committee—M"
502," She had enough left just to carry her into port, and that
was all. 

Having done this, we stood on upon the Brazil coast, southward, till we
came to the mouth of the river Janeiro.  But as we had two days the wind
blowing hard at S"
503," “It’s to be got from someone else—wormed out—screwed and
twisted from him. ”

“What do you mean?” said Mr Dombey. 

“Patience,” she croaked, laying her hand, like a claw, upon his arm. 
“Patience.  I’ll get at it"
504,"

It sprung up a fresh gale in the evening at S. W.  by W. , which, being
fair for the Portugal fleet, and the weather pleasant and agreeable,
we heard the signal given to unmoor, and running in under the island of
Si---, we hauled our mainsail and foresail up in the brails, lowered the
topsails upon the cap, and clewed them up, that we might lie as snug as
we could, expecting their coming out, and the next morning saw the whole
fleet come out accordingly, but not at all to our satisfaction, for they
consisted of twenty-six sail, and most of them ships of force, as well
as burthen, both merchantmen and men-of-war; so, seeing there was no
meddling, we lay still where we were also, till the fleet was out of
sight, and then stood off and on, in hopes of meeting with further
purchase"
505,"

“He ain’t got to be at all secret-like—has he, Polly?” inquired Mr
Toodle. 

“No!” said Mrs Toodle, plumply. 

“I’m glad he ain’t got to be at all secret-like, Polly,” observed Mr
Toodle in his slow and measured way, and shovelling in his bread and
butter with a clasp knife, as if he were stoking himself, “because that
don’t look well; do it, Polly?”

“Why, of course it don’t, father"
506,"”

Her sharp eye had detected an involuntary expression of this feeling on
his part, which was not unreasonable under the circumstances.  In
satisfaction of it she now took the candle to the door she spoke of"
507,"

The captain, who was made desperate by his danger, resolving to clear
the ship of his enemies, tried us all, and we were all condemned to die. 
The manner of his process I was too young to take notice of; but the
purser and one of the gunners were hanged immediately, and I expected it
with the rest"
508,"  Among these he
mentioned the gigantic and grotesque stegosaurus, seen once by Mr. 
Malone at a drinking-place by the lake, and drawn in the sketch-book of
that adventurous American who had first penetrated this unknown world"
509,"

Looking up, we could see them waving their arms from the rocks above
and beckoning to us to join them in their refuge.   In shape they were like horrible
toads, and moved in a succession of springs, but in size they were of
an incredible bulk, larger than the largest elephant"
510," But I know it, and what then! Why,
then, I say, Heaven go with ’em both, and so it will! Amen!”

“Captain Gills,” said Mr Toots, “let me have the pleasure of shaking
hands You’ve a way of saying things, that gives me an agreeable warmth,
all up my back"
511," They could enjoy it at a distance,
at those seasons, every day, though no snow would fall in their streets,
or anywhere near them.

Salt Lake City was healthy—an extremely healthy city"
512," And though
we continued to dine for four days, and had as many breakfasts and
suppers, our whole party never ceased to admire the perfection of the
arrangements, and the marvelous results achieved.  Upon tables covered
with snowy linen, and garnished with services of solid silver, Ethiop
waiters, flitting about in spotless white, placed as by magic a repast
at which Delmonico himself could have had no occasion to blush; and,
indeed, in some respects it would be hard for that distinguished chef to
match our menu; for, in addition to all that ordinarily makes up a
first-chop dinner, had we not our antelope steak (the gormand who has
not experienced this—bah! what does he know of the feast of fat things?)
our delicious mountain-brook trout, and choice fruits and berries, and
(sauce piquant and unpurchasable!) our sweet-scented, appetite-
compelling air of the prairies?



047"
513," At length, one of our men, looking a
little more strictly than the rest, thought he saw the head of one of
the Indians just over a dead limb of the tree, which, it seems, the
creature sat upon.  One man immediately fired, and levelled his piece so
true that the shot went through the fellow's head; and down he fell out
of the tree immediately, and came upon the ground with such force, with
the height of his fall, that if he had not been killed with the shot,
he would certainly have been killed with dashing his body against the
ground"
514,"

The man came back, in great haste, bringing the coachman with him, who
said he had been at home and in bed, since ten o’clock.  He had driven
his mistress to her old house in Brook Street, where she had been met
by Mr Carker—

Florence stood upon the very spot where she had seen him coming down"
515," Our water
had served us two days longer than expected, our buffaloes having found,
for two or three days, a kind of herb like a broad flat thistle, though
without any prickle, spreading on the ground, and growing in the sand,
which they ate freely of, and which supplied them for drink as well as
forage"
516," So
we set all hands to work, unloaded our cargo, and hauled our canoes on
shore, to see if we could carry them. 

Upon examination we found that they were very heavy; but our carpenters,
spending but one day's work upon them, hewed away so much of the timber
from their outsides as reduced them very much, and yet they were as fit
to swim as before"
517," But latterly—you
follow me, Miss Harriet?”

“Perfectly, perfectly,” she answered, with her frightened face fixed on
his.  As if he had resolved to show his employer at one
broad view what has been brought upon him by ministration to his ruling
passion! That it has been his constant practice to minister to that
passion basely, and to flatter it corruptly, is indubitable"
518," Upon his
sacred word of honour, there was no cause of alarm.  But Mr Dombey—

Florence uttered a sudden cry.  He did not look at her, but at Edith. 
Edith composed and reassured her.  She uttered no cry of distress"
519,"  The individual must not monopolize what is
meant for the world.   I shall be pleased to see you at the lecture
to-night.   In the meantime, you will understand that no public use is
to be made of any of the material that I have given you"
520," Forgive me,
dear Papa! oh say God bless me, and my little child!”

He would have said it, if he could.  He would have raised his hands and
besought her for pardon, but she caught them in her own, and put them
down, hurriedly"
521," Long trains of freight wagons in the distance
enveloped in ascending masses of dust suggested pictures of prairies on
fire.  These teams and their masters were the only life we saw.  Otherwise
we moved in the midst of solitude, silence and desolation"
522,"  He glared back at me with hard
angry eyes, but I refused to give way. 

""I will go, Mr.  Chairman,"" I kept repeating over and over again. 

""Name!  Name!"" cried the audience. 

""My name is Edward Dunn Malone"
523,"

“How does she look now?”

“Quite happy,” said Solomon. 

“That’s famous! now I’m off. ”

“I hope you are,” said Solomon to himself. 

“I say, Uncle Sol,” cried Walter, reappearing at the door. 

“Here he is again!” said Solomon"
524,"

""Did you notice the soil?""

""Rocks. ""

""But round the water--where the reeds were?""

""It was a bluish soil.   It looked like clay. ""

""Exactly.   A volcanic tube full of blue clay. ""

""What of that?"" I asked"
525," I’ll try how true and grateful you can be. 
I’ll prove you!” Making this, by his display of teeth and by the action
of his head, as much a threat as a promise, he turned from Rob’s eyes,
which were nailed upon him as if he had won the boy by a charm, body
and soul, and rode away"
526,"

As it was a sight our men had never seen, they were desirous to see it,
and yet a little uneasy at the danger too; for though an elephant is a
heavy unwieldy creature, yet in the deep sand, which is nothing at all
to them, they marched at a great rate, and would soon have tired our
people, if they had had far to go, and had been pursued by them"
527," But when those saw me take a little upon me, as above, they
embraced me, and treated me with particular affection ever after. 

This gunner was an excellent mathematician, a good scholar, and a
complete sailor; and it was in conversing intimately with him that I
learned afterwards the grounds of what knowledge I have since had in all
the sciences useful for navigation, and particularly in the geographical
part of knowledge"
528," That’s nothing,
bless you! Ha ha ha ha! Cap”en Cuttle,” said Mrs MacStinger, with
severe reaction in her voice and manner, “I wish to know if you’re
a-coming home. ”

The frightened Captain looked into his hat, as if he saw nothing for it
but to put it on, and give himself up"
529," The enjoyment of this mercy was a great
comfort to him in captivity, and though he wanted no bodily convenience
that the country did afford; for the king, immediately after his
father's death, had sent an express order to the people of the towns,
that they should be kind to him, and give him good victuals; and after
he had been some time in the country, and understood the language,
he got him good conveniences, as a house and gardens; and falling
to husbandry, God so prospered him, that he had plenty, not only for
himself, but to lend others; which being, according to the custom of the
country, at 50 per cent"
530,"

He sailed for the Chincha Islands in command of a guano ship.  He had a
fine crew, but his negro mate was his pet—on him he had for years
lavished his admiration and esteem.  It was Capt.  Ned’s first voyage to
the Chinchas, but his fame had gone before him—the fame of being a man
who would fight at the dropping of a handkerchief, when imposed upon,
and would stand no nonsense"
531,"’ When his devotions to his
feathered god, Kukailimoku, were concluded, a certain religiously
disposed individual, who had a bird god, suggested to the King that
through its influence his sickness might be removed"
532,"""  She looked at me with rather more interest.   ""That
was brave of you. ""

""I had to.   If you want to write good copy, you must be where the
things are. ""

""What a prosaic motive!  It seems to take all the romance out of it"
533," I flattened myself out in the dust like a
postage stamp, and thought to myself if he mended his aim ever so little
he would probably hear another noise.  In my heart, now, I execrated
secret expeditions"
534,"  She drew back her hands. 

""What do you mean?"" she said. 

""Gladys!"" I cried.   ""What is the matter?  You are my Gladys, are you
not--little Gladys Hungerton?""

""No,"" said she, ""I am Gladys Potts.   Let me introduce you to my
husband"
535," Why, thou wilt destroy us all. ""

""What do you mean, William?"" said I. 

""Mean!"" said he; ""nay, what didst thou mean, to cry out aloud in thy
sleep, 'I am a thief, a pirate, a murderer, and ought to be hanged'?
Why, thou wilt ruin us all"
536,"

“Has there been no night? Is it still day?” asked Florence. 

“Getting on for evening now, my pretty,” said the Captain, drawing back
the curtain of the window.  “See!”

Florence, with her hand upon the Captain’s arm, so sorrowful and timid,
and the Captain with his rough face and burly figure, so quietly
protective of her, stood in the rosy light of the bright evening sky,
without saying a word"
537," Again, the cocked hat and
the mortified bonnet stand in the background at the marriage hour; and
again this man taketh this woman, and this woman taketh this man, on
the solemn terms:

“To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better for worse, for
richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish,
until death do them part"
538,"  Our numbers and
our noise had frightened all living creatures away, and save for a few
pterodactyls, which soared round high above our heads while they waited
for the carrion, all was still around the camp"
539,", in
California and Nevada, were chiefly Chinamen.  There were few white
servants and no Chinawomen so employed.  Chinamen make good house
servants, being quick, obedient, patient, quick to learn and tirelessly
industrious"
540,""" So he gives a word of command, ""Haul up the
main-sail; we'll shorten sail for him. ""

Accordingly we shortened sail, and as we expected her upon our lee-side,
we being then upon our starboard tack, brought eighteen of our guns to
the larboard side, resolving to give him a broadside that should warm
him"
541,"  ""Surely I hear something?""

From the utter silence there emerged a deep, regular pat-pat.   It was
the tread of some animal--the rhythm of soft but heavy pads placed
cautiously upon the ground.   It stole slowly round the camp, and then
halted near our gateway"
542,"
The males were exterminated, Ape Town was destroyed, the females and
young were driven away to live in bondage, and the long rivalry of
untold centuries had reached its bloody end. 

For us the victory brought much advantage"
543," However, we kept our frigate on float by the help of two
great poles, which we fastened into the ground to moor her, like poles;
and the little weak ropes, which, as I said, we had made of matting,
served us well enough to make the vessel fast"
544,"  When they eventually appeared, they took
their places in the front of a platform which already contained all the
leading scientific men, not only of this country, but of France and of
Germany.   An acute observer might, however, have
detected some signs of dissent amid the applause, and gathered that the
proceedings were likely to become more lively than harmonious"
545," This, it seems,
was a solemn vow of friendship.  Upon this we beckoned them with our
hands to come nearer; then they sent the boys and girls to us first,
which, it seems, was to bring us more cakes of bread and some green
herbs to eat, which we received, and took the boys up and kissed them,
and the little girls too; then the men came up close to us, and sat them
down on the ground, making signs that we should sit down by them, which
we did"
546,"""

""Very well, William,"" says I; ""then I shall make an excellent pirate. ""
However, William was in the right, and I apprehended what he meant
immediately; and Captain Wilmot, who lay very sick in his cabin,
overhearing us, understood him as well as I, and called out to me that
William was right, and it was our best way to change our course, and
stand away for the bay, where it was ten to one but we should snap her
in the morning"
547,"

Matters having reached this point, Mr Toodle explained, and the
virtuous feelings of his son being thereby calmed, they shook hands,
and harmony reigned again. 

“Will you do as I do, Biler, my boy?” inquired his father, returning to
his tea with new strength"
548,"

""Well, my idea was that you and I could rush him.   He may be dozin',
and at the worst he can only wing one of us, and the other should have
him.   If we can get his bolster-cover round his arms and then 'phone up
a stomach-pump, we'll give the old dear the supper of his life"
549," Jack took the
hand, and shook it cordially.  He said:

“You twig me, old pard! All right between gents.  Smell of _that_, and
see how you like it!”

And he put a twenty-dollar gold piece in the driver’s hand"
550," It assisted us,
by comparison, to comprehend and appreciate the great depth of the
basin—it looked like a tiny martin-box clinging at the eaves of a
cathedral.  After some little time spent in resting and looking and
ciphering, we hurried on to the hotel"
551," Reeder said it was a d—-d lie, that
Williams had no show at all.  At this, Gumbert drew a knife and stabbed
Reeder, cutting him in two places in the back.  One stroke of the knife
cut into the sleeve of Reeder’s coat and passed downward in a slanting
direction through his clothing, and entered his body at the small of the
back; another blow struck more squarely, and made a much more dangerous
wound"
552," “Mr
Carker, Madam, as you know, possesses my confidence.  He is as well
acquainted as myself with the subject on which I speak.  I beg to tell
you, for your information, Mrs Dombey, that I consider these wealthy
and important persons confer a distinction upon me:” and Mr Dombey drew
himself up, as having now rendered them of the highest possible
importance"
553," And doing
so, and looking back at him with blinded eyes, and stealing timidly
away, passed out of his room, and crossed the other, and was gone. 

He may sleep on now.  He may sleep on while he may.  But let him look for
that slight figure when he wakes, and find it near him when the hour is
come!

Sad and grieving was the heart of Florence, as she crept upstairs"
554," The surface we found,
as the part we passed the day before, had a kind of thick moss upon
it, of a blackish dead colour, but nothing in it that looked like food,
either for man or beast. 

Had we been stored with provisions to have entered for ten or twenty
days upon this wilderness, as we were formerly, and with fresh water, we
had hearts good enough to have ventured, though we had been obliged to
come back again, for if we went north we did not know but we might meet
with the same; but we neither had provisions, neither were we in any
place where it was possible to get them"
555,"

So it seemed to us; and yet we were mistaken.   We had hardly closed the
thornbush door of our zareba, clasped each other's hands, and thrown
ourselves panting upon the ground beside our spring, when we heard a
patter of feet and then a gentle, plaintive crying from outside our
entrance"
556,"”

“Of course,” said Mr Dombey; and sat looking at one page for an hour
afterwards, without reading one word. 

This celebrated Mrs Pipchin was a marvellous ill-favoured,
ill-conditioned old lady, of a stooping figure, with a mottled face,
like bad marble, a hook nose, and a hard grey eye, that looked as if it
might have been hammered at on an anvil without sustaining any injury"
557," They were boarding
around privately, and had their offices in their bedrooms.

The Secretary and I took quarters in the “ranch” of a worthy French lady
by the name of Bridget O’Flannigan, a camp follower of his Excellency
the Governor"
558,"

“There again!” said Jemima.  “What a pity! Father took his dinner with
him this morning, and isn’t coming home till night.  But he’s always
talking of you, Polly, and telling the children about you; and is the
peaceablest, patientest, best-temperedest soul in the world, as he
always was and will be!”

“Thankee, Jemima,” cried the simple Polly; delighted by the speech, and
disappointed by the absence"
559,"

It was easy to swear to do these two things, but it was entirely
impossible to do more than one of them.  When greenbacks had gone down to
forty cents on the dollar, the prices regularly charged everybody by
printing establishments were one dollar and fifty cents per “thousand”
and one dollar and fifty cents per “token,” in _gold_"

Susan Nipper, who had bitten both her bonnet strings at once, and
imparted a great deal of private emotion to the skylight, during this
transaction, now changed the subject by inquiring who took milk and who
took sugar; and being enlightened on these points, poured out the tea"
561," Why, you may think yourselves safer than you are; you do not know
what they may do to you.  I can assure you they are able to do you a
great deal of harm, and perhaps burn your ship. 

W.  Suppose that were true, as I am sure it is false; you see we have
more ships to carry us off (pointing to the sloop)"
562,"

“Several times. ”

“The visit will be tedious to you, I am afraid. ”

“Oh no; not at all. ”

“Ah! You are like your cousin Feenix, my dearest Edith,” said Mrs
Skewton.  “He has been to Warwick Castle fifty times, if he has been
there once; yet if he came to Leamington to-morrow—I wish he would,
dear angel!—he would make his fifty-second visit next day"
563," V.  Waite’s entertaining book, “The
Mormon Prophet,” it transpired that—

“A ‘revelation’ from Brigham Young, as Great Grand Archee or God, was
dispatched to President J.  C.  Haight, Bishop Higbee and J"
564,"

It was in the writing of his great chief, Mr Dombey, and dated from
Leamington.  Though he was a quick reader of all other letters, Mr
Carker read this slowly; weighing the words as he went, and bringing
every tooth in his head to bear upon them"
565," Abundance of little incidents happened upon this march,
which it is impossible to crowd into this account; particularly, we
saw more wild beasts now than we did before, some elephants, and two or
three lions, none of which kinds we had seen any of before; and we
found our negroes were more afraid of them a great deal than we were;
principally, because they had no bows and arrows, or lances, which were
the particular weapons they were bred up to the exercise of"
566,"  God bless
all we leave behind us, and send us safely back. 




                           CHAPTER VII

            ""To-morrow we Disappear into the Unknown""

I will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of
our luxurious voyage upon the Booth liner, nor will I tell of our
week's stay at Para (save that I should wish to acknowledge the great
kindness of the Pereira da Pinta Company in helping us to get together
our equipment)"
567," The
planters whispered us not to mind him—crazy.  They said he was in the
Islands for his health; was a preacher; his home, Michigan.  They said
that if he woke up presently and fell to talking about a correspondence
which he had some time held with Mr"
568," It was a great surprise
to us indeed, because we were disabled so much; but, to our great good
fortune, we lay pretty snug and close among the high rocks, and the
man-of-war did not see us, but stood off again upon his cruise"
569," Not one word
passed the lady’s lips.  She bent her head down over Florence, and she
kissed her on the cheek, but she said no word. 

“Shall we go on through the rooms,” said Mr Dombey, “and see how our
workmen are doing? Pray allow me, my dear madam"
570," In the one place I speak
of, one could look below him upon a world of diminishing crags and
canyons leading down, down, and away to a vague plain with a thread in
it which was a road, and bunches of feathers in it which were trees,—a
pretty picture sleeping in the sunlight—but with a darkness stealing
over it and glooming its features deeper and deeper under the frown of a
coming storm; and then, while no film or shadow marred the noon
brightness of his high perch, he could watch the tempest break forth
down there and see the lightnings leap from crag to crag and the sheeted
rain drive along the canyon-sides, and hear the thunders peal and crash
and roar"
571,"
He gave an interview to Reuter's, and there was such a howl that he saw
it wouldn't do.   It was a discreditable business.   There were one or
two folk who were inclined to take him seriously, but he soon choked
them off"
572,"

His insolence of self-importance dilated as he saw this alteration in
her.  Swollen no less by her past scorn of him, and his so recent
feeling of disadvantage, than by her present submission (as he took it
to be), it became too mighty for his breast, and burst all bounds"
573,"  Conditions have changed, and the beasts died.   Here it
seems that the conditions have not changed, and the beasts have lived. ""

""If ever we get out of this alive, I must have a head with me,"" said
Lord John"
574,"  Each of us picked up a faggot of this, and we
made our way up weed-covered steps to the particular cave which was
marked in the drawing.   It was, as I had said, empty, save for a great
number of enormous bats, which flapped round our heads as we advanced
into it"
575,"  I shall not
dare to publish these articles unless I can bring back my proofs to
England, or I shall be hailed as the journalistic Munchausen of all
time.   I have no doubt that you feel the same way yourself, and that
you would not care to stake the whole credit of the Gazette upon this
adventure until we can meet the chorus of criticism and scepticism
which such articles must of necessity elicit"
576,"

This moidore I ventured to show, that they might not despise me too much
for adding too little to the store, and that they might not pretend to
search me; and they were very civil to me, upon the presumption that I
had been so faithful to them as not to conceal anything from them"
577," The bullet that made it wounded the
driver slightly, but he did not mind it much.  He said the place to keep
a man “huffy” was down on the Southern Overland, among the Apaches,
before the company moved the stage line up on the northern route"
578," “The stock’s the security. 
I’m another.  Your governor’s the man to advance money. ”

“Mr Dombey!” faltered Walter. 

The Captain nodded gravely.  “Look at him,” he said.  “Look at Gills.  If
they was to sell off these things now, he’d die of it"
579,"”

“That he has abused his trust in many ways,” said Mr Morfin; “that he
has oftener dealt and speculated to advantage for himself, than for the
House he represented; that he has led the House on, to prodigious
ventures, often resulting in enormous losses; that he has always
pampered the vanity and ambition of his employer, when it was his duty
to have held them in check, and shown, as it was in his power to do, to
what they tended here or there; will not, perhaps, surprise you now"
580,"

We then considered what we should do to get back again to Madagascar. 
We were much about the latitude of the Cape of Good Hope, but had such a
very long run, and were neither sure of meeting with fair winds nor with
any land in the way, that we knew not what to think of it"
581,"

“Come!” cried the subject of this admiration, returning.  “Before you
have your glass of grog, Ned, we must finish the bottle. ”

“Stand by!” said Ned, filling his glass.  “Give the boy some more. ”

“No more, thank’e, Uncle!”

“Yes, yes,” said Sol, “a little more"
582,"  Some hours later we saw them in single file far out upon the
plain, each with a bundle on his head, making their way back along the
path we had come.   Zambo occupied our little tent at the base of the
pinnacle, and there he remained, our one link with the world below"
583,"  I'll have a try at it, Gladys, if you will only
give me an idea what would please you.   But, above all, he must be a man who could do, who
could act, who could look Death in the face and have no fear of him, a
man of great deeds and strange experiences"
584," Let us
walk. ”

“But you will be so tired, my love. ”

“Oh no! I was very tired the first time that we ever walked together,
but I shall not be so today. ”

And thus—not much changed—she, as innocent and earnest-hearted—he, as
frank, as hopeful, and more proud of her—Florence and Walter, on their
bridal morning, walk through the streets together"
585," Next, we found that it would be
better if a third man got out.  That was an improvement also.  It was at
this time that I volunteered to drive, although I had never driven a
harnessed horse before and many a man in such a position would have felt
fairly excused from such a responsibility"
586," “It must be done, Ma’am,” he says.  “We must marry ’em.  We
must have our national schools to walk at the head of, and we must have
our standing armies.  We must marry ’em, Ma’am,” says Mr Sownds, “and
keep the country going"

We four always spread our common stock of blankets together on the
frozen ground, and slept side by side; and finding that our foolish,
long-legged hound pup had a deal of animal heat in him, Oliphant got to
admitting him to the bed, between himself and Mr"

“Hear the man talk! Of _course_ the tree was reduced that way, but
didn’t I _explain_ it? Answer me, didn’t I? Didn’t I say I wished you
could have seen it when _I_ first saw it? When you got up on your ear
and called me names, and said I had brought you eleven miles to look at
a sapling, didn’t I _explain_ to you that all the whale-ships in the
North Seas had been wooding off of it for more than twenty-seven years?
And did you s’pose the tree could last for-_ever_, con-_found_ it? I
don’t see why you want to keep back things that way, and try to injure a
person that’s never done _you_ any harm"
589," Doctor Blimber then, in a sonorous voice,
delivered a few thoughts in the pastoral style, relative to the rushes
among which it was the intention of himself and Mrs Blimber to dwell,
and the bee that would hum around their cot"
590," It ran with a
very rapid current, and our gunner, pulling out his map, assured me that
this was either the river Nile, or run into the great lake out of which
the river Nile was said to take its beginning; and he brought out his
charts and maps, which, by his instruction, I began to understand very
well, and told me he would convince me of it, and indeed he seemed to
make it so plain to me that I was of the same opinion"
591," But we were
not at a loss what to do; we found the ship we had taken was laden with
nothing considerable for our purpose, except some cocoa, some sugar, and
twenty barrels of flour; the rest of her cargo was hides; so we took
out all we thought fit for our turn, and, among the rest, all her
ammunition, great shot, and small-arms, and turned her off"
592,"

We had not long to wait for our enemy.   A wild shrill clamor rose from
the edge of the wood and suddenly a body of ape-men rushed out with
clubs and stones, and made for the center of the Indian line"
593,"  I thought also of McArdle.   What a three
column article for the paper!  What a foundation for a career!  A
correspondentship in the next great war might be within my reach.   I
clutched at a gun--my pockets were full of cartridges--and, parting the
thorn bushes at the gate of our zareba, quickly slipped out"
594," Meantime the stage was wandering about a plain with gaping
gullies in it, for the driver could not see an inch before his face nor
keep the road, and the storm pelted so pitilessly that there was no
keeping the horses still"
595,"] It was a deliberate offer to
me of Twenty-Five Dollars a week to come up to Virginia and be city
editor of the Enterprise. 

I would have challenged the publisher in the “blind lead” days—I wanted
to fall down and worship him, now"
596,"”

Mrs Chick abandoned herself to her feelings for half a moment; but, as
a practical illustration of her doctrine, brought herself up short, in
the middle of a sob, and went on again. 

“Therefore, Florence, pray let us see that you have some strength of
mind, and do not selfishly aggravate the distress in which your poor
Papa is plunged"
597," Then the fire and noise amazed all their women and
children, and frighted them out of their wits, so that they ran staring
and howling about like mad creatures. 

However, all this did not make them fly, which was what we wanted, nor
did we find any of them die as it were with fear, as at first; so we
resolved upon a second volley, and then to advance as we did before"
598," It is
easy to scribble local rubbish, with the facts all before you; it is
easy to clip selections from other papers; it is easy to string out a
correspondence from any locality; but it is unspeakable hardship to
write editorials"
599," Waldron. )  ""They exploit for fame or cash
the work which has been done by their indigent and unknown brethren. 
One smallest new fact obtained in the laboratory, one brick built into
the temple of science, far outweighs any second-hand exposition which
passes an idle hour, but can leave no useful result behind it"
600,"” The reader will perceive
the exhaustive expressiveness of it in the present instance.

CHAPTER XL. 


I now come to a curious episode—the most curious, I think, that had yet
accented my slothful, valueless, heedless career"
601,"  ""I confess,
however,"" I added, ""that this tiny human figure puzzles me.   If it were
an Indian we could set it down as evidence of some pigmy race in
America, but it appears to be a European in a sun-hat"
602,"
Both of them had spent their lives in those upper waters of the Amazon
which we were about to explore, and it was this recommendation which
had caused Lord John to engage them.   One of them, Gomez, had the
further advantage that he could speak excellent English"
603," At length we came within pistol-shot of one
another, but nobody answered nor appeared; so we began to think that
it was a ship gone ashore somewhere in distress, and the men having
forsaken her, the high tide had floated her off to sea"
604,"
Why, when it comes, it comes; then we are all provided for. ""

""Ay,"" says William, ""that is true; but it would be better that some
things were thought on before that came. ""

""Thought on!"" says I; ""what signifies thinking of it? To think of death
is to die, and to be always thinking of it is to be all one's life long
a-dying"
605,"

“Give it to the driver, please. ”

“Take back your money, madam.  We can’t allow it.  You’re welcome to ride
here as long as you please, but this shebang’s chartered, and we can’t
let you pay a cent"
606," Having done so, he begged to be allowed to hold them, and to hand
them to her as they were required; and thus Mr Carker, with many
commendations of Mrs Granger’s extraordinary skill—especially in
trees—remained—close at her side, looking over the drawing as she made
it"
607,"

“Going? Where are you going?” asked the Captain, looking round at him
over the glasses. 

“What? didn’t you know that I was going to leave you, Captain?” asked
Rob, with a sneaking smile. 

The Captain put down the paper, took off his spectacles, and brought
his eyes to bear on the deserter"
608,"

“Should you? Then I’m sorry that you won’t be satisfied,” returned Miss
Nipper. 

“Hush, Susan! If you please!” said Florence.  “Perhaps you can have the
goodness to tell us where Captain Cuttle lives, Ma’am as he don’t live
here"
609," Not that he cared to whom his daughter turned, or
from whom turned away.  At the same blow, his sister too, who cried
herself to sleep so mournfully, had lost as good and true a friend.  But
that is quite beside the question"
610,"""

""But what, then, must be done with our wealth,"" said I, ""the effects
of plunder and rapine? If we keep it, we continue to be robbers and
thieves; and if we quit it we cannot do justice with it, for we cannot
restore it to the right owners"
611,"”





CHAPTER XLVII. 


Somebody has said that in order to know a community, one must observe
the style of its funerals and know what manner of men they bury with
most ceremony.  I cannot say which class we buried with most eclat in our
“flush times,” the distinguished public benefactor or the distinguished
rough—possibly the two chief grades or grand divisions of society
honored their illustrious dead about equally; and hence, no doubt the
philosopher I have quoted from would have needed to see two
representative funerals in Virginia before forming his estimate of the
people"
612,"  Well,
good-bye.   I'll have the answer for you here on Wednesday morning--if
he ever deigns to answer you.   He is a violent, dangerous, cantankerous
character, hated by everyone who comes across him, and the butt of the
students, so far as they dare take a liberty with him"
613,"

“Do untie your bonnet-strings, and make yourself at home, Miss Nipper,
please,” entreated Jemima.  “I am afraid it’s a poorer place than you’re
used to; but you’ll make allowances, I’m sure. ”

The black-eyed was so softened by this deferential behaviour, that she
caught up little Miss Toodle who was running past, and took her to
Banbury Cross immediately"
614," ""Now,"" says he, ""tell your men not to be afraid; tell them they
shall see that thing in his hand speak in fire to one of those beasts,
and make it kill itself. ""

The poor negroes looked as if they had been all going to be killed,
notwithstanding what their prince said to them, and stood staring to
expect the issue, when on a sudden the gunner fired; and as he was a
very good marksman, he shot the creature with two slugs, just in the
head"
615,"  Here and there high serpent
heads projected out of the water, cutting swiftly through it with a
little collar of foam in front, and a long swirling wake behind, rising
and falling in graceful, swan-like undulations as they went"
616,"  Suddenly,
just as we reach the vessel, there is a shout behind us.   It is
Professor Challenger, who had promised to see us off.   He runs after
us, a puffing, red-faced, irascible figure. 

""No thank you,"" says he; ""I should much prefer not to go aboard"
617," Mrs Pipchin’s wardrobe being handed in and stowed
away, Mrs Pipchin’s chair is next handed in, and placed in a convenient
corner among certain trusses of hay; it being the intention of the
amiable woman to occupy the chair during her journey"
618,"""

""Dirty linen,"" he rumbled.   Where is your dignity, George?""

""How about yours, my dear?""

""You try me too much.   A ruffian--a common brawling ruffian--that's
what you have become.   It was at
least seven feet high, and so thin that she could hardly balance upon
it"
619,"  You shall not
assault me. ""

""Shall I not?""  He was slowly advancing in a peculiarly menacing way,
but he stopped now and put his big hands into the side-pockets of a
rather boyish short jacket which he wore"
620,"

“I should think so,” chuckled Mr Toots. 

“Then all I need observe, is,” said the Captain, “that you know a
angel, and are chartered a angel. ”

Mr Toots instantly seized the Captain’s hand, and requested the favour
of his friendship"
621,"

A man in white clothes, who could only be the surviving half-breed, was
running as one does run when Death is the pacemaker.   Behind him, only
a few yards in his rear, bounded the huge ebony figure of Zambo, our
devoted negro"

one gee! Luff!--bring her to the wind!”

For straight a farmer brought a plank,--(Mysteriously inspired)--And
laying it unto the ship, In silent awe retired"
623,"  At least
I have been driven forth to take part in a wondrous adventure, and I
cannot but be thankful to the force that drove me. 

And now I turn to the last supreme eventful moment of our adventure"
624,"""

""But what do you want in the swamp?""

He looked at me with a very questioning eye, and I read hesitation in
his face. 

""Don't you think other people besides Professors can want to know
things?"" he said at last"
625,"
The bag he had placed at first across two pieces of wood, about a foot
from the ground; and under it he ordered some of our skins to be spread
that would hold water.  In about an hour, and not sooner, the water
began to come dropping through the bottom of the bag, and, to our great
surprise, was perfectly fresh and sweet, and this continued for several
hours; but in the end the water began to be a little brackish"
626,"
So I escaped that part of my master's cruelty. 

And now I resolved from that time to run away from him if I could, but
there was no doing of it there, for there were not ships of any nation
in the world in that port, except two or three Persian vessels from
Ormus, so that if I had offered to go away from him, he would have had
me seized on shore, and brought on board by force; so that I had no

627," He could reflect upon his own place in that heart,
with pride; and with a brave determination, if not to deserve it—he
still thought that far above him—never to deserve it less. 

Some fairy influence must surely have hovered round the hands of Susan
Nipper when she made the tea, engendering the tranquil air that reigned
in the back parlour during its discussion"
628," However, this was a useful experiment
for our future conduct in passing the desert, as you shall hear in its
place. 

We were now upon our work, and our black prince was head surveyor, for
he was an excellent mat-maker himself, and all his men understood it, so
that they soon made us near a hundred mats; and as every man, I mean of
the negroes, carried one, it was no manner of load, and we did not carry
an ounce of provisions the less"
629,"

Next day they marched down the hill on the other side, inclining towards
the seaside, as they had promised, and saw a very pleasant valley before
them, with a river in the middle of it, which, a little farther below
them, seemed to be big enough to bear small ships; they marched apace
towards this river, and were surprised with the noise of a piece going
off, which, by the sound, could not be far off"
630," The world
was very angry indeed; and the people especially, who, in a worse
world, might have been supposed to be apt traders themselves in shows
and pretences, were observed to be mightily indignant"

""Well, it's lucky for you, Challenger, that you ARE a little out of the
ordinary.   If you hadn't been so like the king----""

""Upon my word, Lord John, you allow yourself great latitude. ""

""Well, it's a fact"
633," The riding habit I speak of is simply a long, broad scarf,
like a tavern table cloth brilliantly colored, wrapped around the loins
once, then apparently passed between the limbs and each end thrown
backward over the same, and floating and flapping behind on both sides
beyond the horse’s tail like a couple of fancy flags; then, slipping the
stirrup-irons between her toes, the girl throws her chest forward, sits
up like a Major General and goes sweeping by like the wind"
634,"

So, the heats considered, we resolved to take harbour; besides, our
provisions were exhausted, and we had not many days' store left. 
Accordingly, putting in for the shore early in the morning, as we
usually did once in three or four days for fresh water, we sat down and
considered whether we would go on or take up our standing there; but
upon several considerations, too long to repeat here, we did not like
the place, so we resolved to go on a few days longer"
635,"

The proposal, however good as to the profitable part of it, suited none
of us, for we were all more desirous to get home than to be rich, being
tired of the excessive fatigue of above a year's continual wandering
among deserts and wild beasts"
636,", of setting up a long pole, and put us in mind that
perhaps it was the same thing to them as a flag of truce to us.  So we
resolved to try it; and accordingly the next time we saw any of their
fishing-boats at sea we put up a pole in our canoe that had no sail, and
rowed towards them"

“The agony I have endured,” she said mincingly, “as the truth has by
degrees dawned upon me, has been too exceedingly terrific to dilate
upon.  My whole existence is bound up in my sweetest Edith; and to see

garnered up her heart since the death of that most delightful creature,
Granger—is the most affecting thing in the world"

Lively Proceedings. ""  My scientific education having been somewhat
neglected, I was unable to follow the whole argument, but it was
evident that the English Professor had handled his subject in a very
aggressive fashion, and had thoroughly annoyed his Continental
colleagues"
640," If my
wife has any superfluous gentleness, and duty over and above her proper
submission to me, she may bestow them where she pleases, perhaps; but I
will have submission first!—Carker,” said Mr Dombey, checking the
unusual emotion with which he had spoken, and falling into a tone more
like that in which he was accustomed to assert his greatness, “you will
have the goodness not to omit or slur this point, but to consider it a
very important part of your instructions"
641," He shortly fought his
way to a higher post and a more powerful—President of the Twelve.  The
neighbors rose up and drove the Mormons out of Ohio, and they settled in
Missouri.  Brigham went with them"
642,"  It was a
valiant move but a foolish one, for the great bandy-legged creatures
were slow of foot, while their opponents were as active as cats.   It
was horrible to see the fierce brutes with foaming mouths and glaring
eyes, rushing and grasping, but forever missing their elusive enemies,
while arrow after arrow buried itself in their hides"
643,"  Behold the
result!""

He put one hand in the front of his ragged jacket and pointed proudly
with the other. 

By this time the gas-bag had swollen to a goodly rotundity and was
jerking strongly upon its lashings"
644," That is, Johnny was—but I held his hat.  While
smoking the pipe of peace after breakfast we watched the sentinel peaks
put on the glory of the sun, and followed the conquering light as it
swept down among the shadows, and set the captive crags and forests
free"
645,"  Finally he
described, amongst some merriment, the ingenious but highly dangerous
aeronautic invention of Professor Challenger, and wound up a most
memorable address by an account of the methods by which the committee
did at last find their way back to civilization"
646," “It is not necessary to prolong these
observations.  The woman is discharged and paid.  You leave this house,
Richards, for taking my son—my son,” said Mr Dombey, emphatically
repeating these two words, “into haunts and into society which are not
to be thought of without a shudder"

“Out’ard bound with fair weather, then, I say,” cried Captain Cuttle. 

Mr Carker smiled assent. 

“Wind right astarn, and plenty of it,” pursued the Captain. 

Mr Carker smiled assent again. 

“Ay, ay!” said Captain Cuttle, greatly relieved and pleased"
648,"  But,
to my amazement, a second man was seated in front of him.   For an
instant my heart leaped for joy, as I thought that one of my comrades
had made his way safely down.   But a second glance dispelled the hope"
649," But he was an
ingenious man.  He said it was not the lantern that had informed him that
we were out of the path, but his _feet_.  He had noticed a crisp grinding
of fine lava-needles under his feet, and some instinct reminded him that
in the path these were all worn away"
650," At the same
time, Alice, from her opposite chair, watched it narrowly as it shaped
the letters, and repeated each one on her lips as he made it, without
articulating it aloud.  At the end of every letter her eyes and Mr
Dombey’s met, as if each of them sought to be confirmed by the other;
and thus they both spelt D"

After Buck Fanshaw’s inquest, a meeting of the short-haired brotherhood
was held, for nothing can be done on the Pacific coast without a public
meeting and an expression of sentiment.  Regretful resolutions were
passed and various committees appointed; among others, a committee of
one was deputed to call on the minister, a fragile, gentle, spiritual
new fledgling from an Eastern theological seminary, and as yet
unacquainted with the ways of the mines"

Java, the other said it was pithecanthropus.   Madness, I call
it--Loonies, both.   But, as I say, I had thought out one or two points
that were helpful.   One was that these brutes could not run as fast as
a man in the open"

together that day to the lake where some of the natives, under their
direction, were engaged in harpooning specimens of the great lizards.

were scattered about upon the grassy slope in front of the caves

The cayote will go swinging gently off on that deceitful trot of his,
and every little while he will smile a fraudful smile over his shoulder
that will fill that dog entirely full of encouragement and worldly
ambition, and make him lay his head still lower to the ground, and
stretch his neck further to the front, and pant more fiercely, and stick
his tail out straighter behind, and move his furious legs with a yet
wilder frenzy, and leave a broader and broader, and higher and denser
cloud of desert sand smoking behind, and marking his long wake across
the level plain! And all this time the dog is only a short twenty feet
behind the cayote, and to save the soul of him he cannot understand why
it is that he cannot get perceptibly closer; and he begins to get
aggravated, and it makes him madder and madder to see how gently the
cayote glides along and never pants or sweats or ceases to smile; and he
grows still more and more incensed to see how shamefully he has been
taken in by an entire stranger, and what an ignoble swindle that long,
calm, soft-footed trot is; and next he notices that he is getting
fagged, and that the cayote actually has to slacken speed a little to
keep from running away from him—and _then_ that town-dog is mad in
earnest, and he begins to strain and weep and swear, and paw the sand
higher than ever, and reach for the cayote with concentrated and
desperate energy"

breakfast”—the good lady seemed curious on the subject of Princess’s
Place, and looked all round it as she spoke—“with my brother, who has
come home. ”

“He is better, I trust, my love,” faltered Miss Tox"
660," The captain took what I said to
him quite wrong, and pretended to resent it, and gave me some buccaneer
words upon it; but I gave him no return to it but this: that I advised
him for his advantage; that if he did not understand it so, it was his
fault, not mine; that I did not forbid him to go, nor had I offered
to persuade any of the men not to go with him, though it was to their
apparent destruction"
661,"

“Who then?”

“Can you not guess who then?”

“I do not choose to guess,” she answered. 

“Madam,” he said after a little hesitation; meantime they had been, and
still were, regarding each other as before; “I am in a difficulty here"
662," They waste nothing.  What is rubbish to a
Christian, a Chinaman carefully preserves and makes useful in one way or
another.  He gathers up all the old oyster and sardine cans that white
people throw away, and procures marketable tin and solder from them by
melting"
663,"

However, as it pleased God that the wind continued fair at S. E.  and by
E. , we found that N. W.  by W. , which was right afore it, was as good a
course for us as any we could go, and thus we went on"
664," But troubles thickened about them.  In their wanderings
one brother fell and broke his leg, and the others were obliged to go on
and leave him to die in the wilderness.  Another, worn out and starving,
gave up by and by, and laid down to die, but after two or three weeks of
incredible hardships, the third reached the settlements of California
exhausted, sick, and his mind deranged by his sufferings"

“And bear a hand and cheer up,” said the Captain, patting him on the
back.  “What! There’s more than one sweet creetur in the world!”

“Not to me, Captain Gills,” replied Mr Toots gravely.  “Not to me, I
assure you"
666," His hand was cold, and loose, and scarcely
closed upon her. 

“You are tired, I daresay,” he said, taking up the light, and leading
her towards the door, “and want rest.  We all want rest.  Go, Florence"
667,"  G.  E.  C.  is happiest then.   Well, sir, let us do what we can
to curtail this visit, which can hardly be agreeable to you, and is
inexpressibly irksome to me.   You had, as I have been led to believe,
some comments to make upon the proposition which I advanced in my
thesis"
668," When they had marched in this way about
a mile, at a given signal the slaughter commenced.  The women and children ran on, two
or three hundred yards further, when they were overtaken and with the
aid of the Indians they were slaughtered"
669," I’m here to have a
good time, and money ain’t any object.  I mean to have the nobbiest rig
that’s going.  Now here comes the very trick.  Stop that yaller one with

Another pause. 

“Where are you going to live?” said Higbie. 

“San Francisco. ”

“That’s me!”

Pause. 

“Too high—too much climbing”—from Higbie. 

“What is?”

“I was thinking of Russian Hill—building a house up there"
671," I see no
occasion thou hast of keeping thus far south any longer than till you
are sure you are to the west end of Java and Sumatra; and then thou
mayest stand away north towards Ceylon, and the coast of Coromandel and
Madras, where thou mayest get both fresh water and fresh provisions; and
to that part it is likely we may hold out well enough with the stores we
have already"

honest but homely face"

“Placed affection?” suggested Miss Tox, timidly. 

“Good gracious, Lucretia!” returned Mrs Chick “How very monstrous!
Misanthrope, is the word I want.  The idea! Misplaced affection! I say,
if any misanthrope were to put, in my presence, the question ‘Why were
we born?’ I should reply, ‘To make an effort’"
674,"  High up above our heads, amid the dark
shadows, there was one circle of deeper gloom.   Surely it could only be
the opening of a cave. 

The base of the cliff was heaped with loose stones at the spot, and it
was not difficult to clamber up"
675,"  It
is clear that it is all thickly wooded, and it would take months to

there were some central peak it would be different, but it all slopes

cunning, cunning man! One shouldn’t tell these things; your sex, my
dear Dombey, are so vain, and so apt to abuse our weakness; but you

This was addressed to one of the very tall young men who announced
dinner"

The pastry-cook is hard at work in the funereal room in Brook Street,

young men already smells of sherry, and his eyes have a tendency to
become fixed in his head, and to stare at objects without seeing them"

""We can at least all reach the summit,"" said he.   ""When we are up I may

After breakfast we unpacked the bundle in which our leader had brought
his climbing accessories"
679," You do not—you do not,” faltered Florence,
“speak of Papa; but I am sure you wish that I should ask him for his
forgiveness.  I am sure you do. ”

She answered not a word. 

“I will!” said Florence.  “I will bring it you, if you will let me; and
then, perhaps, we may take leave of each other, more like what we used
to be to one another"
680," The end of these first holidays
was to witness his separation from Florence, but who ever looked
forward to the end of holidays whose beginning was not yet come! Not
Paul, assuredly.  As the happy time drew near, the lions and tigers
climbing up the bedroom walls became quite tame and frolicsome"

It was a very pleasant sight to us when, coming on shore, we saw all
the marks and tokens of a ship-carpenter's yard; as a launch-block and
cradles, scaffolds and planks, and pieces of planks, the remains of
the building a ship or vessel; and, in a word, a great many things
that fairly invited us to go about the same work; and we soon came to
understand that the men belonging to the ship that was lost had saved
themselves on shore, perhaps in their boat, and had built themselves a
barque or sloop, and so were gone to sea again; and, inquiring of the
natives which way they went, they pointed to the south and south-west,
by which we could easily understand they were gone away to the Cape of
Good Hope"

""Why, only,"" says he, ""that the next time thou talkest with the devil,

just as it appeared in the _Daily Territorial Enterprise_:

But what about our mines? I shall be candid with you.  I shall express an
honest opinion, based upon a thorough examination"
686," He told me he had done all he could to
obtain my pardon of the captain, but could not and he knew no way for me
but to have patience, and submit to my fate; and if they came to speak
with any ship of their nation at the Cape, he would endeavour to have
them stand in, and fetch us off again, if we might be found"

No man could do that.  It _fell_ in the tree when it came down. ”

“Oh—exactly. ”

“Certainly.  I unwound the lariat, and fastened one end of it to the
limb.  It was the very best green raw-hide, and capable of sustaining
tons"

Burgess and Co.  have altered my measure, I’m in that state of thinness"
692," Two of them had made their market, and were going home with
nutmegs, cinnamon, cloves, &c. , besides all sorts of European goods,
brought with the Spanish ships from Acapulco.  They had together
eight-and-thirty ton of cloves, and five or six ton of nutmegs, and as
much cinnamon"
693," “Someone
said Walter.  Is he here? I should like to see him very much. ”

Nobody replied directly; but his father soon said to Susan, “Call him
back, then: let him come up!” Alter a short pause of expectation,
during which he looked with smiling interest and wonder, on his nurse,
and saw that she had not forgotten Floy, Walter was brought into the
room"
694," However turbulent his thoughts, or harsh his anger had
been, at first, concerning her marriage, or her husband, that was all
past now.  He chiefly thought of what might have been, and what was not. 
What was, was all summed up in this: that she was lost, and he bowed
down with sorrow and remorse"
695,"  We then slowly and cautiously set
forth into the unknown, following the course of the little stream which
flowed from our spring, as it should always serve us as a guide on our
return. 

Hardly had we started when we came across signs that there were indeed
wonders awaiting us"
696," So does Wickam. ”

“Who is Wickam?” asked Miss Blimber. 

“She has been my nurse,” Paul answered. 

“I must beg you not to mention Wickam to me, then,” said Miss Blimber. 
“I couldn’t allow it”. 

“You asked me who she was,” said Paul"
697,"  Summerlee gave a cry and
put his hand to his face, from which the blood was streaming.   I felt a
prod at the back of my neck, and turned dizzy with the shock. 
Challenger fell, and as I stooped to pick him up I was again struck
from behind and dropped on the top of him"
698,"T. ” Mr. 
Dimsdale’s chapter is well worth reading, as a specimen of how the
people of the frontier deal with criminals when the courts of law prove
inefficient.  Mr.  Dimsdale makes two remarks about Slade, both of which
are accurately descriptive, and one of which is exceedingly picturesque:
“Those who saw him in his natural state only, would pronounce him to be
a kind husband, a most hospitable host and a courteous gentleman; on the
contrary, those who met him when maddened with liquor and surrounded by
a gang of armed roughs, would pronounce him a fiend incarnate"
699,"”

Bunsby, with his eye on the coast of Greenland, seemed to listen for
the contents.  The Captain therefore hemmed to clear his throat, and
read the letter aloud. 

“‘My dear Ned Cuttle.  When I left home for the West Indies’—”

Here the Captain stopped, and looked hard at Bunsby, who looked fixedly
at the coast of Greenland"

“He can’t, can’t he? Since you know so much about it, did you ever see a
bull try?”

“No! I never dreamt of such a thing. ”

“Well, then, what is the use of your talking that way, then? Because you
never saw a thing done, is that any reason why it can’t be done?”

“Well, all right—go on"
701,"

At the word “wife” (which he had uttered without design), the Captain
stopped, cocked his eye again, and putting the glazed hat on the top of
the knobby stick, gave it a twirl, and looked sideways at his always
smiling friend"
702," “Pray tell me all the worst at once. ”

“Latterly, he appears to have devoted the greatest pains to making
these results so plain and clear, that reference to the private books
enables one to grasp them, numerous and varying as they are, with
extraordinary ease"
703,"  I remember his wail at the
meeting, which began:  'In fifty years experience of scientific
intercourse----'  It quite broke the old man up. ""

""Anything more about Challenger?""

""Well, I'm a bacteriologist, you know"
704,"” They did
not wait for the timbers to dry, but the whole tribe or nation sailed
the next day.  Then a bit of genuine nature cropped out, and is revealed
by outspoken Nephi with Scriptural frankness—they all got on a spree!
They, “and also their wives, began to make themselves merry, insomuch
that they began to dance, and to sing, and to speak with much rudeness;
yea, they were lifted up unto exceeding rudeness"
705,"  In vain they strove
to break loose.   They were held in their lofty places of honor.   It
would have been hard to let them down if it had been wished, so dense
was the crowd around them.   'Regent Street!  Regent Street!' sounded
the voices"
706," On the other hand, they pointed to
our boat and to their ship, asking questions as well as they could, and
said a thousand things, and expressed themselves with great earnestness;
but we could not understand a word of it all, or know what they meant by
any of their signs"
707," We had
been now five months and upwards in our journey, and the seasons began
to change; and nature told us, that, being in a climate that had a
winter as well as a summer, though of a different kind from what our
country produced, we were to expect a wet season, and such as we should
not be able to travel in, as well by reason of the rain itself, as of
the floods which it would occasion wherever we should come; and
though we had been no strangers to those wet seasons in the island
of Madagascar, yet we had not thought much of them since we began our
travels; for, setting out when the sun was about the solstice, that is,
when it was at the greatest northern distance from us, we had found
the benefit of it in our travels"
708,"

As we had concluded, that where there were hills there would be springs,
so it happened; but we were not only surprised, but really frighted, to
find the first spring we came to, and which looked admirably clear and
beautiful, to be salt as brine"
709," I went to bed all on fire with excitement; for nobody
had yet gone East to sell a Nevada silver mine, and the field was white
for the sickle.  I felt that such a mine as the one described by Dan
would bring a princely sum in New York, and sell without delay or
difficulty"
710,"

“Why do you rest in the rain?” said Harriet, gently. 

“Because I have no other resting-place,” was the reply. 

“But there are many places of shelter near here.  This,” referring to
the little porch, “is better than where you were"
711," He told us it was preposterous not to take
the fruit of all our labours now we were come to the harvest; that we
might see the hazard the Europeans run with ships and men, and at great
expense, to fetch a little gold, and that we, that were in the centre
of it, to go away empty-handed was unaccountable; that we were strong
enough to fight our way through whole nations, and might make our
journey afterward to what part of the coast we pleased, and we should
never forgive ourselves when we came to our own country to see we had
500 pistoles in gold, and might as easily have had 5000 or 10,000, or
what we pleased; that he was no more covetous than we, but seeing it
was in all our powers to retrieve our misfortunes at once, and to make
ourselves easy for all our lives, he could not be faithful to us, or
grateful for the good we had done him, if he did not let us see the
advantage we had in our hands; and he assured us he would make it clear
to our own understanding, that we might in two years' time, by good
management and by the help of our negroes, gather every man a hundred
pounds weight of gold, and get together perhaps two hundred ton of
teeth; whereas, if once we pushed on to the coast and separated, we
should never be able to see that place again with our eyes, or do any
more than sinners did with heaven,--wish themselves there, but know they
can never come at it"
712,"

This work was too hot to hold long; our men behaved bravely: our gunner,
a gallant man, shouted below, pouring in his shot at such a rate, that
the Portuguese began to slacken their fire; we had dismounted several of
their guns by firing in at their forecastle, and raking them, as I said,
fore and aft"
713,"  Now, upon his assigning some duty to his fellow-Professor
(it was only the carrying of an aneroid barometer), the matter suddenly
came to a head. 

""May I ask, sir,"" said Summerlee, with vicious calm, ""in what capacity
you take it upon yourself to issue these orders?""

Challenger glared and bristled"
714,"  No, Mr. 
Malone, I will place no restriction upon your correspondence, since the
ventilation of the facts is the object of your journey; but I demand
that you shall give no particulars as to your exact destination, and
that nothing be actually published until your return"
715,"  His eyebrows were tufted and overhanging, which gave those
naturally cold eyes an almost ferocious aspect, an impression which was
increased by his strong and furrowed brow.   In figure he was spare, but
very strongly built--indeed, he had often proved that there were few
men in England capable of such sustained exertions"
716,"  The sketch, the photographs, the narrative, and now the
actual specimen--the evidence was complete.   I said so--I said so
warmly, for I felt that the Professor was an ill-used man.   He leaned
back in his chair with drooping eyelids and a tolerant smile, basking
in this sudden gleam of sunshine"
717," She
seemed to have followed Florence some little way at all events, for she
had lost her breath; and this made her uglier still, as she stood
trying to regain it: working her shrivelled yellow face and throat into
all sorts of contortions"
718,"

""It's up to you, young fellah, to name the lake,"" said he.   ""You saw it
first, and, by George, if you choose to put 'Lake Malone' on it, no one
has a better right. ""

""By all means.   Let our young friend give it a name,"" said Challenger"
719,"  Then Lord John threw a bundle of
twigs upon the fire, and their red glare lit up the intent faces of my
companions and flickered over the great boughs above our heads. 

""What was it?"" I whispered. 

""We shall know in the morning,"" said Lord John"
720," Here also they
were put in a great fright by the coming of certain soldiers from the
king to the governor, to give him orders to set a secure guard at the
watches, that no suspicious persons might pass, which, though it was
only intended to prevent the flight of the relations of certain nobles
whom the king had clapped up, yet they feared they might wonder to see
white men here, and so send them back again; but God so ordered it that
they were very kind to them and left them to their business, and so they
got safe to Anuradhapoora"
721," But no softness or humility
ensued on that.  She did not lay her head down now, and weep, and say
that she had no hope but in Florence.  She held it up as if she were a
beautiful Medusa, looking on him, face to face, to strike him dead"
722,"N. E. , till we found some
creek or river, that we might run up into the country, or some town

""Oh, you brute!  Please! please!""

He took her down as if she had been a canary.

As we passed into these seas, steering due north, so we soon crossed the
line to the north side, and so sailed on towards Mindanao and Manilla,
the chief of the Philippine Islands, without meeting with any purchase
till we came to the northward of Manilla, and then our trade began;
for here we took three Japanese vessels, though at some distance from
Manilla"
725,"  Always in front of us we heard the
yelling and roaring which showed the direction of the pursuit.   As we arrived the Indians, a semicircle of spearmen, had
closed in on them, and in a minute it was over, Thirty or forty died
where they stood"

making for the Cape de Bona Speranza; so we had no comfort from her. 

We went, therefore, immediately to work about our intended canoe; and,
having singled out a very large tree to our minds, we fell to work with
her; and having three good axes among us, we got it down, but it was
four days' time first, though we worked very hard too"
727,"""

It was as brave an act as ever I saw a man do.   He stooped to the fire,
picked up a blazing branch, and slipped in an instant through a
sallyport which he had made in our gateway.   The thing moved forward
with a dreadful snarl"
728," A very seedy looking vagabond passenger
got out of the stage a moment to wait till the usual ballast of silver
bricks was thrown in.  He was standing on the pavement, when an awkward
express employee, carrying a brick weighing a hundred pounds, stumbled
and let it fall on the bummer’s foot"

material change.

It was at such a moment that I learned the stuff of which my three
comrades were composed.   They were grave, it is true, and thoughtful,
but of an invincible serenity.   For the moment we could only sit among
the bushes in patience and wait the coming of Zambo"
731," We
did not wish to strain it. 

By and by our provisions began to run short, and we went back to the old
camp and laid in a new supply.  We were gone all day, and reached home
again about night-fall, pretty tired and hungry"
732," He fled
amain to us, and the truth is, we did not know what to do, for we were
told no bullet would enter her; and we found it so at first, for though
three of our men fired at her, yet she did not mind them; but my friend
the gunner, a venturous fellow, of a bold heart, and great presence
of mind, went up so near as to thrust the muzzle of his piece into her
mouth, and fired, but let his piece fall, and ran for it the very moment
he had fired it"
733,"  ""I think he will
be the most useful at this task.   I must beg, however, that you will
kindly refrain from thinking for yourself, and that you will do exactly
what you are told. ""

Under his direction I cut such gashes in the sides of the trees as
would ensure that it should fall as we desired"
734,"  Was this the
luxurious Lord John Roxton who had sat that evening in the Albany
amidst his Persian rugs and his pictures in the pink radiance of the
tinted lights?  And was this the imposing Professor who had swelled
behind the great desk in his massive study at Enmore Park?  And,
finally, could this be the austere and prim figure which had risen
before the meeting at the Zoological Institute?  No three tramps that
one could have met in a Surrey lane could have looked more hopeless and
bedraggled"
735,"

This was good advice, and too rational not to be taken; but our present
business was, what to do to get out of this dreadful place we were in. 
Behind us was a waste, which had already cost us five days' march, and
we had not provisions for five days left to go back again the same way"
736,"  Like a dado round the room
was the jutting line of splendid heavy game-heads, the best of their
sort from every quarter of the world, with the rare white rhinoceros of
the Lado Enclave drooping its supercilious lip above them all"
737," Only open your eyes to show me that you hear and understand
me; will you? Good Heaven, gentlemen, what is to be done!”

The two medical attendants exchanged a look across the bed; and the
Physician, stooping down, whispered in the child’s ear"
738,"
The house is a ruin, and the rats fly from it. 

Mrs Pipchin’s apartments, together with those locked rooms on the
ground-floor where the window-blinds are drawn down close, have been
spared the general devastation"

N. E.  and the E. N. E.  We were nine weeks in this voyage, having met with
several interruptions by the weather, and put in under the lee of a
small island in the latitude of 16 degrees 12 minutes, of which we never
knew the name, none of our charts having given any account of it: I
say, we put in here by reason of a strange tornado or hurricane, which
brought us into a great deal of danger"
741,"

Some time after this, they brought us roots and herbs, and some fruits
which I cannot remember, and gave us; but as we had nothing to give
them, we found them not so free as the people in Madagascar were"
742,"

But we had not marched above twelve days more, eight whereof were taken
up in rounding the lake, and four more south-west, in order to make for
the river Congo, but we were put to another full stop, by entering a
country so desolate, so frightful, and so wild, that we knew not what to
think or do; for, besides that it appeared as a terrible and boundless
desert, having neither woods, trees, rivers, or inhabitants, so even the
place where we were was desolate of inhabitants, nor had we any way to
gather in a stock of provisions for the passing of this desert, as we
did before at our entering the first, unless we had marched back four
days to the place where we turned the head of the lake"
743," I shall
have often an occasion to speak of him in the rest of the story. 

Our cruising so long in these seas began now to be so well known, that
not in England only, but in France and Spain, accounts had been made
public of our adventures, and many stories told how we murdered the
people in cold blood, tying them back to back, and throwing them into
the sea; one half of which, however, was not true, though more was done
than is fit to speak of here"
744," For which,” aside to Mr Toots, “you’ll overhaul your Adam and
Eve, brother. ”

“I shall make a point of doing so, Captain Gills,” said Mr Toots. 

“Although I have heard something of the changes of events, from her,”
resumed the Instrument-maker, taking his old spectacles from his
pocket, and putting them on his forehead in his old manner, “they are
so great and unexpected, and I am so overpowered by the sight of my
dear boy, and by the,”—glancing at the downcast eyes of Florence, and
not attempting to finish the sentence—“that I—I can’t say much
tonight"
745,"

We had not sailed long but we chased a small Chinese junk, and having
taken her, we found she was bound to the island of Formosa, having no
goods on board but some rice and a small quantity of tea; but she had
three Chinese merchants in her; and they told us that they were going to
meet a large vessel of their country, which came from Tonquin, and lay
in a river in Formosa, whose name I forgot; and they were going to the
Philippine Islands, with silks, muslins, calicoes, and such goods as
are the product of China, and some gold; that their business was to sell
their cargo, and buy spices and European goods"

hands! By George, you want the head shot off you awful bad!”

and of course, went straight to the hottest corner of perdition,—and the
next day he _telegraphed back for his blankets. _ There is no doubt about
the truth of this statement—there can be no doubt about it"
749,"

But our first voyage being only to coast the island, we resolved to
venture, whatever the hazard or consequence of it might be, and in order
to preserve as much fresh water as we could, our carpenter made a well
athwart the middle of one of our canoes, which he separated from the
other parts of the canoe, so as to make it tight to hold the water and
covered so as we might step upon it; and this was so large that it held
near a hogshead of water very well"
750," The swift sharp agony struck through him, as he
thought of what his son might do. 

His son cried lustily that night, at all events.  Sooth to say, poor
Paul had better reason for his tears than sons of that age often have,
for he had lost his second mother—his first, so far as he knew—by a
stroke as sudden as that natural affliction which had darkened the
beginning of his life"
751," Nature was of no
consequence at all.  No matter what a young gentleman was intended to
bear, Doctor Blimber made him bear to pattern, somehow or other. 

This was all very pleasant and ingenious, but the system of forcing was
attended with its usual disadvantages"
752,"

Accordingly, he went away from us in an evil hour; for, instead of
taking a ship to follow us, he was taken, as I heard afterwards, by
an English man-of-war, and being laid in irons, died of mere grief
and anger before he came to England"
753," Mighty fine family.  Old Maryland
stock.  Old Squire Hogadorn could carry around more mixed licker, and
cuss better than most any man I ever see.  His second wife was the widder
Billings—she that was Becky Martin; her dam was deacon Dunlap’s first
wife"

“Don’t say a word,” he whispered.  “Let her ride, if she wants to. 
Gracious, there’s room enough. ”

The young lady got out her porte-monnaie, and handed her fare to Col. 
Jack. 

“What’s this for?” said he"
755," I wrote and begged him to solve the difficult problem if
possible and save the student’s life.  My interest grew, until it partook
of the anxiety of the mother.  I waited in much suspense. —At last the
answer came"
756," Whether it was that the company
did not do him justice in restoring his circumstances, or in further
employing him, he quitted their service, and was employed by those
called separate traders, and being afterwards out of employ there
also, traded on his own account; when, passing unwarily into one of the
company's settlements, he was either betrayed into the hands of some of
the natives, or, somehow or other, was surprised by them"
757," He abandoned the gate business after that
and went along peaceably enough, but absorbed in meditation.  I noticed
this latter circumstance, and it soon began to fill me with
apprehension.  I said to my self, this creature is planning some new
outrage, some fresh deviltry or other—no horse ever thought over a
subject so profoundly as this one is doing just for nothing"
758," What are you looking in at the
door for?—” continued Walter, apostrophizing an old gentleman with a
powdered head (inaudibly to him of course), who was staring at a ship’s
telescope with all his might and main"
759," Proud he desired that she should be, but she must be
proud for, not against him.  As he sat alone, hardening, he would often
hear her go out and come home, treading the round of London life with
no more heed of his liking or disliking, pleasure or displeasure, than
if he had been her groom"
760," If thy general knows no better, he may begin
when he will; but thou mayest be sure we will return it to his cost. 

D.  What must I do, then?

W.  Do! Why, go to him, and tell him of it beforehand, then; and let
him know that the ship firing is not at him nor his men; and then come
again, and tell us what he says"
761,"

The first proof we had of their kindness was, that as soon as they saw
us come on shore and begin to make our habitation, one of their captains
or kings, for we knew not what to call them, came down with five or six
men and some women, and brought us five goats and two young fat
steers, and gave them to us for nothing; and when we went to offer them
anything, the captain or the king would not let any of them touch it,
or take anything of us"
762," It would be black
ingratitude in me to hint at such a thing,” returned the other.  “Though
believe me, James, I am as sorry for her sacrifice as you. ”

“As I?” exclaimed the Manager.  “As I?”

“As sorry for her choice—for what you call her choice—as you are angry
at it,” said the Junior"
763,"  All five were
sitting up, balancing themselves upon their broad, powerful tails and
their huge three-toed hind-feet, while with their small five-fingered
front-feet they pulled down the branches upon which they browsed"
764," “I never see
such a thing as this!”

“What is the matter, Mrs Pipchin?” said Mr Dombey, looking round. 
“Softly! Pray!”

Mrs Pipchin, in her deference, merely muttered at the young man as she
passed on, and said, “Oh! he was a precious fellow”—leaving the young
man, who was all meekness and incapacity, affected even to tears by the
incident"
765,"

“As to alteration in her, Sir,” mused the Major on his way back; on
which expedition—the afternoon being sunny and hot—he ordered the
Native and the light baggage to the front, and walked in the shadow of
that expatriated prince: “as to alteration, Sir, and pining, and so
forth, that won’t go down with Joseph Bagstock, None of that, Sir"
766," I told him we would strive to outdo them in civility,
and that we would make good every part of his agreement; in token
whereof, I caused a white flag likewise to be spread at the poop of our
great ship, which was the signal agreed on"
767,"

Challenger thrust out his aggressive chin until he was all beard and
hat-rim.   ""No doubt, sir, a limited knowledge would have that effect. 
When one's knowledge is exhaustive, one comes to other conclusions"
768,"

By this mischance we lost the advantages, whatever they were, of the
three sail of ships, which we afterwards came to hear were small Dutch
ships from Batavia, going to Banda and Amboyna, to load spice, and, no
doubt, had a good quantity of money on board"
769," Nye at Carson City (distant one hundred and fifty-six miles). 

On the nineteenth day we crossed the Great American Desert—forty
memorable miles of bottomless sand, into which the coach wheels sunk
from six inches to a foot"
770," “What do you mean?” said he.  “You have
no right to ask me what I mean,” was the quiet reply, “get your horse at
once, and remember what I tell you. ” After a short pause he promised to
do so, and actually got into the saddle; but, being still intoxicated,
he began calling aloud to one after another of his friends, and at last
seemed to have forgotten the warning he had received and became again
uproarious, shouting the name of a well-known courtezan in company with
those of two men whom he considered heads of the committee, as a sort of
challenge; perhaps, however, as a simple act of bravado"
771,"  ""Not another word,
Sir!  You should have been at the office for evening duty half an hour
ago; only I hadn't the heart to remind you.   Some day, perhaps, when
you have won your place in the world, we shall talk it over again"
772,"

“Dear Mr Toots,” said Florence, “you are so friendly to me, and so
honest, that I am sure I may ask a favour of you. ”

“Miss Dombey,” returned Mr Toots, “if you’ll only name one,
you’ll—you’ll give me an appetite"
773," When the captain found how it was,
and that there was no help for it, he began to be a little appeased, and
made light of it, and called up the men, and spoke kindly to them, and
told them he was very well satisfied in the fidelity and ability of
those that were now left, and that he would give to them, for their
encouragement, to be divided among them, the wages which were due to the
men that were gone, and that it was a great satisfaction to him that the
ship was free from such a mutinous rabble, who had not the least reason
for their discontent"
774," Every time the stranger tried to
appease the enemy he only made matters worse.  Finally he offered to
rewrite the chapter.  This arrested hostilities.  The indignation
gradually quieted down, peace reigned again and the sufferer retired in
safety and got him to his own citadel"
775," When he found that our store was but small,
he said he would talk with the natives, and we should have provisions
enough; for he said they were the most courteous, good-natured part of
the inhabitants in all that part of the country, as we might suppose by
his living so safe among them"
776," The old, old fashion! The fashion that came in with our
first garments, and will last unchanged until our race has run its
course, and the wide firmament is rolled up like a scroll.  The old, old
fashion—Death!

Oh thank GOD, all who see it, for that older fashion yet, of
Immortality! And look upon us, angels of young children, with regards
not quite estranged, when the swift river bears us to the ocean!

“Dear me, dear me! To think,” said Miss Tox, bursting out afresh that
night, as if her heart were broken, “that Dombey and Son should be a
Daughter after all!”




CHAPTER XVII"
777,"

And yet there were indications that even human life itself was not far
from us in those mysterious recesses.   On the third day out we were
aware of a singular deep throbbing in the air, rhythmic and solemn,
coming and going fitfully throughout the morning"
778,"”

“Sir!” cried Mr Toots, starting from his chair and shaking hands with
him anew, “the relief is so excessive, and unspeakable, that if you
were to tell me now that Miss Dombey was married even, I could smile"
779," No, not one of them; I have no apprehensions upon that account at
all. 

_W_.  Why, then, answer me plainly, if thou art a Christian: Is it safe
for us to venture upon their words, to put ourselves into their hands,
and come on shore?

_D_"
780," I am informed
that when a certain Mr.  L. , a visiting stranger, was here, he bought a
pair of very respectable-looking match horses from a native.  They were
in a little stable with a partition through the middle of it—one horse
in each apartment"
781,"

The next thing we had to consider was, how to carry our baggage, which
we were first of all determined not to travel without; neither indeed
was it possible for us to do so, for even our ammunition, which was
absolutely necessary to us, and on which our subsistence, I mean for
food, as well as our safety, and particularly our defence against wild
beasts and wild men, depended,--I say, even our ammunition was a load
too heavy for us to carry in a country where the heat was such that we
should be load enough for ourselves"
782,")  'I
have mentioned the ape-men, and I cannot forbear from saying that some
of the sounds which now meet my ears bring back most vividly to my
recollection my experiences with those interesting creatures"
783," It was by this only cable that we rode it out all night;
and towards morning we thought the wind abated a little; and it was well
for us that it was so, for, in spite of what our sheet-anchor did for
us, we found the ship fast aground in the morning, to our very great
surprise and amazement"
784,"

When I understood that my master was so apparently kind, I asked if I
might not be admitted to speak with him, and they told me I might, if my
master would come down to me, but I could not be allowed to come up to
him; so then I desired my master might be spoke to to come to me, and he
accordingly came to me"
785," He talked about Utah, and the Indians,
and Nevada, and general American matters and questions, with our
secretary and certain government officials who came with us.  But he
never paid any attention to me, notwithstanding I made several attempts
to “draw him out” on federal politics and his high handed attitude
toward Congress"
786,"

We lay here several days before we could furnish ourselves with the
provisions agreed for, and some of the men fancied the Dutchmen were
contriving our destruction; but they were very honest, and did what they
could to furnish the black cattle, but found it impossible to supply so
many"
787," He thought the United States would admire both his economy
and his honesty in getting the work done at half price and not putting a
pretended Indian’s signature to the voucher, but the United States did
not see it in that light"
788," The priests told them
that death and everlasting punishment would overtake any who violated
the oath, and the march was resumed.  Kamehameha drove them back step by
step; the priests fought in the front rank and exhorted them both by
voice and inspiriting example to remember their oath—to die, if need be,
but never cross the fatal line"
789,""" ""But,"" says William, ""the men have done thee
no injury at all; thou hast taken a great treasure from them; what canst
thou pretend to hurt them for?"" ""Nay, William,"" says I, ""do not talk of
that; I have pretence enough, if that be all; my pretence is, to
prevent doing me hurt, and that is as necessary a piece of the law of
self-preservation as any you can name; but the main thing is, I know not
what to do with them, to prevent their prating"
790," Frequently a
solemn raven sat upon the skull or the hips and contemplated the passing
coach with meditative serenity.

By and by Carson City was pointed out to us.  It nestled in the edge of a
great plain and was a sufficient number of miles away to look like an
assemblage of mere white spots in the shadow of a grim range of
mountains overlooking it, whose summits seemed lifted clear out of
companionship and consciousness of earthly things"
791,"  After a few hundred yards of thick forest,
containing many trees which were quite unknown to me, but which
Summerlee, who was the botanist of the party, recognized as forms of
conifera and of cycadaceous plants which have long passed away in the
world below, we entered a region where the stream widened out and
formed a considerable bog"

“I will come home on the very day, Mama”

“Do so.  I rely on that promise.  Now, prepare to come with me, dear
girl.  You will find me downstairs when you are ready. ”

Slowly and thoughtfully did Edith wander alone through the mansion of
which she was so soon to be the lady: and little heed took she of all
the elegance and splendour it began to display"

after a deal of fighting, that Coriantumr, upon making calculation of
his losses, found that “there had been slain two millions of mighty men,
and also their wives and their children”—say 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 in
all—“and he began to sorrow in his heart"
794,"

From hence we sailed to the Canaries, and from thence onward to the
West Indies, where we committed some depredation upon the Spaniards for
provisions, and took some prizes, but none of any great value, while I
remained with them, which was not long at that time; for, having taken a
Spanish sloop on the coast of Carthagena, my friend made a motion to me,
that we should desire Captain Wilmot to put us into the sloop, with a
proportion of arms and ammunition, and let us try what we could do; she
being much fitter for our business than the great ship, and a better
sailer"

“We lost one babby,” observed Toodle, “there’s no denyin’. ”

“Lately,” added Mr Dombey, looking at the cap. 

“No, Sir, up’ard of three years ago, but all the rest is hearty.  And in
the matter o readin’, Sir,” said Toodle, ducking again, as if to remind
Mr Dombey of what had passed between them on that subject long ago,
“them boys o’ mine, they learned me, among ’em, arter all"
796,"  Its owner grabbed at its legs, but too late to hold
it.   It had sprung from the perch and was circling slowly round the
Queen's Hall with a dry, leathery flapping of its ten-foot wings, while
a putrid and insidious odor pervaded the room"
797,"

The first things this gentleman did for us were indeed of the greatest
consequence to us; for, first, he perfectly informed us where we were,
and which was the properest course for us to steer; secondly, he put
us in the way how to furnish ourselves effectually with provisions; and
thirdly, he was our complete interpreter and peacemaker with all the
natives, who now began to be very numerous about us, and who were a
more fierce and politic people than those we had met with before; not so
easily terrified with our arms as those, and not so ignorant as to give
their provisions and corn for our little toys, such as, I said before,
our artificer made; but as they had frequently traded and conversed with
the Europeans on the coast, or with other negro nations that had traded
and been concerned with them, they were the less ignorant and the
less fearful, and consequently nothing was to be had from them but by
exchange for such things as they liked"
798,"

We inquired in the country, and found there was no beast of burthen
known among them, that is to say, neither horses or mules, or asses,
camels, or dromedaries; the only creature they had was a kind of
buffalo, or tame bull, such a one as we had killed; and that some of
these they had brought so to their hand, that they taught them to go and
come with their voices, as they called them to them, or sent them from
them; that they made them carry burthens; and particularly that they
would swim over rivers and lakes upon them, the creatures swimming very
high and strong in the water"
799,"
Townsend made a calculation.  Then he said to the men:

“So you have taken a contract to run a tunnel into this hill two hundred
and fifty feet to strike this ledge?”

“Yes, sir. ”

“Well, do you know that you have got one of the most expensive and
arduous undertakings before you that was ever conceived by man?”

“Why no—how is that?”

“Because this hill is only twenty-five feet through from side to side;
and so you have got to build two hundred and twenty-five feet of your
tunnel on trestle-work!”

800," Over your head Mount Davidson lifted
its gray dome, and before and below you a rugged canyon clove the
battlemented hills, making a sombre gateway through which a soft-tinted
desert was glimpsed, with the silver thread of a river winding through
it, bordered with trees which many miles of distance diminished to a
delicate fringe; and still further away the snowy mountains rose up and
stretched their long barrier to the filmy horizon—far enough beyond a
lake that burned in the desert like a fallen sun, though that, itself,
lay fifty miles removed"

Paul had sunk into a sweet sleep, and dreamed that he was walking hand

She submitted to be led into the house, and, evidently more in
gratitude than in any care for herself, washed and bound the injured

She hurriedly put her work aside, and laid her head down on his pillow,

be better soon.

Presently we got under way again.  We came to the shallow, yellow, muddy
South Platte, with its low banks and its scattering flat sand-bars and
pigmy islands—a melancholy stream straggling through the centre of the
enormous flat plain, and only saved from being impossible to find with
the naked eye by its sentinel rank of scattering trees standing on

After imparting this precious piece of information, the Major, who was

812," The captain, rather provoked than cowed with
this, came to the barricade of the quarter-deck, and speaking very
prudently to the men (for had he spoken roughly, two-thirds of them
would have left the ship, if not all of them), he told them, it was
for their safety as well as his own that he had been obliged to that
severity; that mutiny on board a ship was the same thing as treason in a
king's palace, and he could not answer it to his owners and employers
to trust the ship and goods committed to his charge with men who had
entertained thoughts of the worst and blackest nature; that he wished
heartily that it had been anywhere else that they had been set on shore,
where they might have been in less hazard from the savages; that, if he
had designed they should be destroyed, he could as well have executed
them on board as the other two; that he wished it had been in some other
part of the world, where he might have delivered them up to the civil
justice, or might have left them among Christians; but it was better
their lives were put in hazard than his life, and the safety of the
ship; and that though he did not know that he had deserved so ill of any
of them as that they should leave the ship rather than do their duty,
yet if any of them were resolved to do so unless he would consent to
take a gang of traitors on board, who, as he had proved before them
all, had conspired to murder him, he would not hinder them, nor for the
present would he resent their importunity; but, if there was nobody left
in the ship but himself, he would never consent to take them on board"

We sailed along there, not in sight of the shore only, but so near as to
see the ships in the road at Fort St David, Fort St George, and at
the other factories along that shore, as well as along the coast of
Golconda, carrying our English ancient when we came near the Dutch
factories, and Dutch colours when we passed by the English factories"

In the fever of his mortification and unavailing rage, the panic that

821," The general was
fool enough to give him orders to go, and charged him not to come back
without the captain; which he readily promised, and very honestly might. 

So they took him in, and brought him on board, and he was as good as
his word to them, for he never went back to them any more; and the sloop
being come to the mouth of the inlet where we lay, we weighed and set
sail; but, as we went out, being pretty near the shore, we fired three
guns, as it were among them, but without any shot, for it was of no
use to us to hurt any more of them"

Here we came to a resolution to go away to the coast of Brazil, and from
thence to the Cape of Good Hope, and so for the East Indies; but Captain
Harris, as I have said, being now captain of the brigantine, alleged

However, I am forgetting.  I did have one other occupation beside that of
“slinking. ” It was the entertaining of a collector (and being
entertained by him,) who had in his hands the Virginia banker’s bill for
forty-six dollars which I had loaned my schoolmate, the “Prodigal"
825," If they had come up, we should have given them an unexpected
welcome, but as it was, we had no mind to follow them; so we let them
go, for the same reasons which I mentioned before. 

But though we let them pass, we did not design to let others go at so
easy a price"

However, as it put the men into juntos and cabals, they were not
composed for some hours; the wind also slackening towards night, the
captain ordered not to weigh till next morning. 

The same night twenty-three of the men, among whom was the gunner's
mate, the surgeon's assistant, and two carpenters, applying to the chief
mate told him, that as the captain had given them leave to go on shore
to their comrades, they begged that he would speak to the captain not to
take it ill that they were desirous to go and die with their companions;
and that they thought they could do no less in such an extremity than
go to them; because, if there was any way to save their lives, it was
by adding to their numbers, and making them strong enough to assist one
another in defending themselves against the savages, till perhaps they
might one time or other find means to make their escape, and get to
their own country again"

running to him, calling out before he came to him, ""It is the Bible!""
The words startled him, and he flung down his angle to meet him, and,
finding it was true, was mightily rejoiced to see it; but he was afraid
he should not have enough to purchase it, though he was resolved to part
with all the money he had, which was but one pagoda, to buy it; but his
black boy persuading him to slight it, and leave it to him to buy it, he
at length obtained it for a knit cap"

“And he runs awa-a-a-y!” cried Mrs MacStinger, with a lengthening out

But we were quite confounded when, on a sudden, we found the fire all
put out by a great quantity of water thrown upon it.  We then thought the
devil must be in them, to be sure.  Says William, ""This is certainly the
cunningest piece of Indian engineering that ever was heard of; and there
can be but one thing more to guess at, besides witchcraft and dealing
with the devil, which I believe not one word of,"" says he; ""and that
must be, that this is an artificial tree, or a natural tree artificially
made hollow down into the earth, through root and all; and that these
creatures have an artificial cavity underneath it, quite into the hill,
or a way to go through, and under the hill, to some other place; and
where that other place is, we know not; but if it be not our own fault,
I'll find the place, and follow them into it, before I am two days
older"
885,"

“That is the device,” returned Louisa. 

“But do me the justice to remember, my dear Louisa,” said Miss Tox in a
tone of low and earnest entreaty, “that nothing but the—I have some
difficulty in expressing myself—the dubiousness of the result would
have induced me to take so great a liberty: ‘Welcome, Master Dombey,’
would have been much more congenial to my feelings, as I am sure you
know"
886," If these authors had
wrought as voluminously as newspaper editors do, the result would be
something to marvel at, indeed.  How editors can continue this tremendous
labor, this exhausting consumption of brain fibre (for their work is
creative, and not a mere mechanical laying-up of facts, like reporting),
day after day and year after year, is incomprehensible"
887,"

“Time was,” he said, “when it was well to watch even your rising little
star, and know in what quarter there were clouds, to shadow you if
needful.  But a planet has arisen, and you are lost in its light"
888,"”

“That’s right,” said Solomon, greatly relieved. 

“I say, Uncle Sol,” cried Walter, putting his face in at the door. 

“Here he is again,” said Solomon. 

“We met Mr Carker the Junior in the street, queerer than ever"
889,"




CHAPTER LIX. 
Retribution


Changes have come again upon the great house in the long dull street,
once the scene of Florence’s childhood and loneliness.  It is a great
house still, proof against wind and weather, without breaches in the
roof, or shattered windows, or dilapidated walls; but it is a ruin none
the less, and the rats fly from it"
890," Florence might be all the happier too for that, perhaps,
when he came back. 

When he came back! Fifty times a day, his noiseless little feet went up
the stairs to his own room, as he collected every book, and scrap, and
trifle that belonged to him, and put them all together there, down to
the minutest thing, for taking home! There was no shade of coming back
on little Paul; no preparation for it, or other reference to it, grew
out of anything he thought or did, except this slight one in connexion
with his sister"
891," Not even upon the staff of the
flag—for that, a needle in the distance at any time, was now untouched
by the light and undistinguishable in the gloom.  For a whole hour the
weird visitor winked and burned in its lofty solitude, and still the
thousands of uplifted eyes watched it with fascinated interest"
892," The moment they were face
to face alone, Mr Carker, without a word of preparation, took him by
the throat, and shook him until his head seemed loose upon his
shoulders. 

The boy, who in the midst of his astonishment could not help staring
wildly at the gentleman with so many white teeth who was choking him,
and at the office walls, as though determined, if he were choked, that
his last look should be at the mysteries for his intrusion into which
he was paying such a severe penalty, at last contrived to utter—

“Come, Sir! You let me alone, will you!”

“Let you alone!” said Mr Carker"
893," But still I was at a loss how, and where, and by whom to
settle this charity, not daring to go home to my own country, lest some
of my comrades, strolled home, should see and detect me, and for the
very spoil of my money, or the purchase of his own pardon, betray and
expose me to an untimely end"
894,", for
ourselves.  I shall not take up any of the little room I have left here
with the further particulars of our trade; it is enough to mention,
that, except a parcel of tea, and twelve bales of fine China wrought
silks, we took nothing in exchange for our goods but gold; so that the
sum we took here in that glittering commodity amounted to above fifty
thousand ounces good weight"
895,"

The _tabu_ broken and destruction failing to follow the awful sacrilege,
the people, with that childlike precipitancy which has always
characterized them, jumped to the conclusion that their gods were a weak
and wretched swindle, just as they formerly jumped to the conclusion
that Captain Cook was no god, merely because he groaned, and promptly
killed him without stopping to inquire whether a god might not groan as
well as a man if it suited his convenience to do it; and satisfied that
the idols were powerless to protect themselves they went to work at once
and pulled them down—hacked them to pieces—applied the torch—annihilated
them!

The pagan priests were furious"
896,"

The music of their voices was very far from being pleasant to us, and
sometimes would be so very disturbing that we could not sleep for it;
and often our sentinels would call us that were awake to come and look
at them"
897,", we were obliged to stand away
towards the coast of Africa and the Cape Guardafui, the winds being more
variable under the shore than in the open sea. 

Here we chopped upon a booty which we did not look for, and which made
amends for all our waiting; for the very same hour that we made land we
spied a large vessel sailing along the shore to the southward"
898,"
And long may you—et ceterer. ” Which, to judge from the expression of
his face, did not include any very choice blessings.  “And here’s her
health,” said the Grinder, glancing at Alice, who sat with her eyes
fixed, as it seemed to him, on the wall behind him, but in reality on
Mr Dombey’s face at the door, “and wishing her the same and many of
’em!”

He drained the glass to these two sentiments, and set it down"
899," But we were satisfied with it. 

We were land owners now, duly seized and possessed, and within the
protection of the law.  Therefore we decided to take up our residence on
our own domain and enjoy that large sense of independence which only
such an experience can bring"
900," She troubled his peace.  He
would have preferred to put her idea aside altogether, if he had known
how.  Perhaps—who shall decide on such mysteries!—he was afraid that he
might come to hate her. 

When little Florence timidly presented herself, Mr Dombey stopped in
his pacing up and down and looked towards her"
901,"

The next time Robbins got sick, Jacops tried to make up with him, and
varnished up the same old coffin and fetched it along; but old Robbins
was too many for him; he had him in, and ’peared to be powerful weak; he
bought the coffin for ten dollars and Jacops was to pay it back and
twenty-five more besides if Robbins didn’t like the coffin after he’d
tried it"
902," Then;
for a while, he had gained a meagre living by sewing up bursted sacks of
grain on the piers; when that failed he had found food here and there as
chance threw it in his way.  He had ceased to show his face in daylight,
now, for a reporter knows everybody, rich and poor, high and low, and
cannot well avoid familiar faces in the broad light of day"
903,"_” He once
said of a little, half-starved, wayside community that had no
subsistence except what they could get by preying upon chance passengers
who stopped over with them a day when traveling by the overland stage,
that in their Church service they had altered the Lord’s Prayer to read:
“Give us this day our daily stranger!”

We expected great things of the Occidental"
904,"  We had both seized
our magazine rifles and ran out to see what the danger could be. 
Suddenly from the near belt of trees there broke forth a group of
twelve or fifteen Indians, running for their lives, and at their very
heels two of those frightful monsters which had disturbed our camp and
pursued me upon my solitary journey"
905,"

""We have seven more minutes,"" said he.   ""The old dear is very precise. ""

Professor Summerlee gave an acid smile as he picked up the envelope in
his gaunt hand. 

""What can it possibly matter whether we open it now or in seven
minutes?"" said he"
906," He walked two hours and a half, and at last his face lit up
happily and he told Buncombe it had occurred to him that the ranch
underneath the new Morgan ranch still belonged to Hyde, that his title
to the ground was just as good as it had ever been, and therefore he was
of opinion that Hyde had a right to dig it out from under there and—

The General never waited to hear the end of it"
907," “To be howled over
like this here!”

“Won’t you come and see me, Robby?” cried Mrs Brown.  “Oho, won’t you
ever come and see me?”

“Yes, I tell you! Yes, I will!” returned the Grinder. 

“That’s my own Rob! That’s my lovey!” said Mrs Brown, drying the tears
upon her shrivelled face, and giving him a tender squeeze"
908," She had been unwelcome to him from the first; she
was an aggravation of his bitterness now.  If his son had been his only
child, and the same blow had fallen on him, it would have been heavy to
bear; but infinitely lighter than now, when it might have fallen on her
(whom he could have lost, or he believed it, without a pang), and had
not"
909," Then he takes three
or four pieces of eight, and beats them out with a hammer upon a stone,
till they were very broad and thin; then he cuts them out into the shape
of birds and beasts; he made little chains of them for bracelets and
necklaces, and turned them into so many devices of his own head, that it
is hardly to be expressed"
910,"  The
ape-men had been driven back to their city, they had made a last stand
there, once again they had been broken, and now we were in time to see
the final fearful scene of all.   Some eighty or a hundred males, the
last survivors, had been driven across that same little clearing which
led to the edge of the cliff, the scene of our own exploit two days
before"
911," Such of the Goshoots as we saw, along the road and hanging
about the stations, were small, lean, “scrawny” creatures; in complexion
a dull black like the ordinary American negro; their faces and hands
bearing dirt which they had been hoarding and accumulating for months,
years, and even generations, according to the age of the proprietor; a
silent, sneaking, treacherous looking race; taking note of everything,
covertly, like all the other “Noble Red Men” that we (do not) read
about, and betraying no sign in their countenances; indolent,
everlastingly patient and tireless, like all other Indians; prideless
beggars—for if the beggar instinct were left out of an Indian he would
not “go,” any more than a clock without a pendulum; hungry, always
hungry, and yet never refusing anything that a hog would eat, though
often eating what a hog would decline; hunters, but having no higher
ambition than to kill and eat jack-ass rabbits, crickets and
grasshoppers, and embezzle carrion from the buzzards and cayotes;
savages who, when asked if they have the common Indian belief in a Great
Spirit show a something which almost amounts to emotion, thinking
whiskey is referred to; a thin, scattering race of almost naked black
children, these Goshoots are, who produce nothing at all, and have no
villages, and no gatherings together into strictly defined tribal
communities—a people whose only shelter is a rag cast on a bush to keep
off a portion of the snow, and yet who inhabit one of the most rocky,
wintry, repulsive wastes that our country or any other can exhibit"
912,"

When they came by the ship's side which I commanded we hailed them
in the usual manner, to know what and who they were, and what their
business.  They answered they were Englishmen, and desired to come on
board"
913," But it was not death that I meant when I said that there was
something to be thought of beyond this way of living. ""

""Why, William,"" said I, ""what was that?""

""It was repentance,"" says he. 

""Why,"" says I, ""did you ever know a pirate repent?""

At this he startled a little, and returned, ""At the gallows I have
[known] one before, and I hope thou wilt be the second"
914," After a few glasses of wine, he gives
Miss Dombey’s health, observing, “Feeder, you have no idea of the
sentiments with which I propose that toast. ” Mr Feeder replies, “Oh,
yes, I have, my dear Toots; and greatly they redound to your honour,
old boy"
915," “You have not told me that. ”

“The joy,” she replied, attiring herself, with fumbling fingers, “of no
love at all, and much pride and hate, my deary.  The joy of confusion
and strife among ’em, proud as they are, and of danger—danger, Alice!”

“What danger?”

“I have seen what I have seen"
916,"

They were succeeded by a gentle tap at the door. 

“Mrs Chick,” said a very bland female voice outside, “how are you now,
my dear friend?”

“My dear Paul,” said Louisa in a low voice, as she rose from her seat,
“it’s Miss Tox"
917," Our camp was like a little town, in which our huts were
in the centre, having one large one in the centre of them also, into
which all our particular lodgings opened; so that none of us went into
our apartments but through a public tent, where we all ate and drank
together, and kept our councils and society; and our carpenters made us
tables, benches, and stools in abundance, as many as we could make use
of"
918,"  It was not until it had settled again that I dared to steal
onwards upon my journey. 

The night had been exceedingly still, but as I advanced I became
conscious of a low, rumbling sound, a continuous murmur, somewhere in
front of me"
919,"  The line of cliffs, which had decreased
considerably in height, had already begun to trend from west to north,
and if we could take this as representing the arc of a circle, the
whole circumference could not be very great"
920,"""

As Challenger spoke of his pterodactyl I glanced at Professor
Summerlee, and for the first time I seemed to see some signs of a
dawning credulity and repentance.   There was no sneer upon his thin
lips, but, on the contrary, a gray, drawn look of excitement and
amazement"
921,"  Thrusting in my head between the stems, I found myself
gazing at a fleshless skull.   The whole skeleton was there, but the
skull had detached itself and lay some feet nearer to the open.   A gold watch by Hudson, of New York, and a
chain which held a stylographic pen, lay among the bones"
922," Twenty-four hours afterward these bottles would be
still lying on the glassy water under our noses, showing that the ship
had not moved out of her place in all that time.  The calm was absolutely
breathless, and the surface of the sea absolutely without a wrinkle"
923," We fired a gun for them to
bring to; so they manned out their boat, and sent to us with a flag of
truce.  We sent back the boat, but with this answer to the captain, that
he had nothing to do but to strike and bring his ship to an anchor
under our stern, and come on board us himself, when he should know our
demands; but that, however, since he had not yet put us to the trouble
of forcing him, which we saw we were able to do, we assured them that
the captain should return again in safety, and all his men, and that,
supplying us with such things as we should demand, his ship should not
be plundered"
924," So, having spent a good part of the day in
our surprise at the thing, and consulting what to do, we set forward to
the north. 

We travelled upon the shore of this sea full twenty-three days before
we could come to any resolution about what it was; at the end of which,
early one morning, one of our seamen cried out, ""Land!"" and it was no
false alarm, for we saw plainly the tops of some hills at a very great
distance, on the further side of the water, due west; but though this
satisfied us that it was not the ocean, but an inland sea or lake, yet
we saw no land to the northward, that is to say, no end of it, but were
obliged to travel eight days more, and near 100 miles farther, before
we came to the end of it, and then we found this lake or sea ended in a
very great river which ran N"
925,"

But we forgot to engage the prince in the secret, who innocently told so
much to all the rest, as that they guessed what it was, and came to us
to see.  When we found it was public, we were more concerned to prevent
their suspecting that we had any design to conceal it, and openly
telling our thoughts of it, we called our artificer, who agreed
presently that it was gold; so I proposed that we should all go with
the prince to the place where he found it, and if any quantity was to be
had, we would lie here some time and see what we could make of it"
926,"




CHAPTER XVI. 
What the Waves were always saying


Paul had never risen from his little bed.  He lay there, listening to
the noises in the street, quite tranquilly; not caring much how the
time went, but watching it and watching everything about him with
observing eyes"
927,"""

""Not only a fellow-countryman, my good sir,"" said Challenger, ""but
also, if I may be allowed to enlarge your simile, an ally of the first
value.   This beech tree will be our saviour. ""

""By George!"" cried Lord John, ""a bridge!""

""Exactly, my friends, a bridge!  It is not for nothing that I expended
an hour last night in focusing my mind upon the situation"
928," Here also our gunner took
an observation with his forestaff, to determine our latitude, and he
found now, that having marched about thirty-three days northward, we
were in 6 degrees 22 minutes south latitude"
929,"""

How absurd life is!  I found myself mechanically bowing and shaking
hands with a little ginger-haired man who was coiled up in the deep
arm-chair which had once been sacred to my own use.   We bobbed and
grinned in front of each other"
930,"  Don't wait any longer or
he may suspect.   If you find him dangerous--really dangerous--ring the
bell and hold him off until I come.   Even at his worst I can usually
control him. ""

With these encouraging words the lady handed me over to the taciturn
Austin, who had waited like a bronze statue of discretion during our
short interview, and I was conducted to the end of the passage"
931," Calla lilies, all sorts of geraniums, passion flowers, moss
roses—I do not know the names of a tenth part of them.  I only know that
while New Yorkers are burdened with banks and drifts of snow,
Californians are burdened with banks and drifts of flowers, if they only
keep their hands off and let them grow"
932,"  The more
I tried to think it out with my confused and weary brain the less could
I find any plausible explanation.   I searched round in the forest, but
could see no tracks which could help me to a conclusion"
933,"

It was not more than forty feet across at the mouth, but it rapidly
closed until it ended in an acute angle, too straight and smooth for an
ascent.   Certainly it was not this which our pioneer had attempted to
indicate"
934,"
_Tried_! Mind you, I don’t object to trying him, if it’s got to be done
to give satisfaction; and I’ll be there, and chip in and help, too; but
put it off till afternoon—put it off till afternoon, for I’ll have my
hands middling full till after the burying—”

“Why, what do you mean? Are you going to _hang_ him any how—and try him
afterward?”

“Didn’t I say I was going to _hang_ him? I never saw such people as you"
935,"

“But the inner dressing-room was locked and the key gone. ”

Her father seized a candle that was flaming on the ground—someone had
put it down there, and forgotten it—and came running upstairs with such
fury, that Florence, in her fear, had hardly time to fly before him"
936,"

We had no sooner given orders for our little camp, and given leave to
our negroes to lay down their loads, but they fell to work to build our
huts; and though they were tied as above, yet they did it so nimbly as
surprised us"
937," It was better and easier to keep her secret shut up there,
among the tall dark walls, than to carry it abroad into the light, and
try to hide it from a crowd of happy eyes.  It was better to pursue the
study of her loving heart, alone, and find no new discouragements in
loving hearts about her"
938," The men were almost
all shot down at the first fire from the guard.  Two only escaped, who
fled to the desert, and were followed one hundred and fifty miles before
they were overtaken and slaughtered"
939,"  I hold you to your word, Challenger.   From now  onwards
you devote your energies to getting us out of this horrible country and
back once more to civilization. ""




                            CHAPTER XV

                ""Our Eyes have seen Great Wonders""

I write this from day to day, but I trust that before I come to the end
of it, I may be able to say that the light shines, at last, through our
clouds"
940," No, I do not say so; my countrymen live a great way off, on the
north and east parts of the island, and there is no going to them
without the king's express license.  Why, my reason is good; if thou art a Christian and a prisoner,
how canst thou consent to be made an instrument to these barbarians,
to betray us into their hands, who are thy countrymen and
fellow-Christians? Is it not a barbarous thing in thee to do so?

_D_"
941," Pray, what gain is
in it? and what account can you give the captain for his lost men?"" In
short, William argued so effectually, that he convinced them that it
was mere murder to do so; and that the men had a right to their own,
and that they had no right to take them away; that it was destroying
innocent men, who had acted no otherwise than as the laws of nature
dictated; and that it would be as much murder to do so, as to meet a man
on the highway, and kill him, for the mere sake of it, in cold blood,
not regarding whether he had done any wrong to us or no"
942," Solitude.  No creature was near.  Then I
returned to my mine, fortifying myself against possible disappointment,
but my fears were groundless—the shining scales were still there.  I set
about scooping them out, and for an hour I toiled down the windings of
the stream and robbed its bed"
943,"” Its foliage is a grayish green, and gives that tint to
desert and mountain.  It smells like our domestic sage, and “sage-tea”
made from it taste like the sage-tea which all boys are so well
acquainted with"
944,"

“Cheerily,” said the Captain.  “Cheerily! Stand by, my pretty one, stand
by! There! You’re better now.  Steady’s the word, and steady it is.  Keep
her so! Drink a little drop o’ this here,” said the Captain"
945,"

Accordingly we went every man of us, for no man was willing to be left
behind in a discovery of such a nature.  When we came to the place we
found it was on the west side of the river, not in the main river, but
in another small river or stream which came from the west, and ran into
the other at that place"
946," He was a surgeon, and they called him doctor; but he was not
employed in the sloop as a surgeon, but was going to Barbados to get a
berth, as the sailors call it.  However, he had all his surgeon's chests
on board, and we made him go with us, and take all his implements with
him"
947,"

The Major now salutes the Bride right gallantly, and carries out that
branch of military tactics in reference to all the ladies:
notwithstanding Mrs Skewton’s being extremely hard to kiss, and
squeaking shrilly in the sacred edifice"
948," The
tropics are not, for all the sentiment that is wasted on them.  They seem
beautiful at first, but sameness impairs the charm by and by.  _Change_
is the handmaiden Nature requires to do her miracles with"
949," What the thing was that happened to him and his
grandfather’s old ram is a dark mystery to this day, for nobody has ever
yet found out.

CHAPTER LIV. 


Of course there was a large Chinese population in Virginia—it is the
case with every town and city on the Pacific coast"
950,"

""I was turning away from him when I observed that something projected
from the front of his ragged jacket.   It was this sketch-book, which
was as dilapidated then as you see it now.   Indeed, I can assure you
that a first folio of Shakespeare could not be treated with greater
reverence than this relic has been since it came into my possession"
951," But
more reverently. 

“If the day should ever come,” said Harriet, “when he is restored, in
part, to the position he lost—”

“Restored!” cried the gentleman, quickly.  “How can that be hoped for?
In whose hands does the power of any restoration lie? It is no mistake
of mine, surely, to suppose that his having gained the priceless
blessing of his life, is one cause of the animosity shown to him by his
brother"
952,"

""You brute, George!"" she screamed.   ""You've hurt that nice young man. ""

He jerked backwards with his thumb. 

""Here he is, safe and sound behind me. ""

She was confused, but not unduly so. 

""I am so sorry, I didn't see you"
953,"  Who else?""

""Well, then, the photographs?""

""There was nothing in the photographs.   If you are clever and know your business you can fake a bone
as easily as you can a photograph. ""

I began to feel uneasy"
954,"

At length we came to a very large bay, and in it several little creeks
or rivers emptying themselves into the sea, and we ran boldly into the
first creek we came at; where, seeing some huts and wild people about
them on the shore, we ran our vessel into a little cove on the north
side of the creek, and held up a long pole, with a white bit of cloth
on it, for a signal of peace to them"
955,"
Indeed, I think my country was ashamed to have so improvident a person
in its employ. 

Those “instructions” (we used to read a chapter from them every morning,
as intellectual gymnastics, and a couple of chapters in Sunday school
every Sabbath, for they treated of all subjects under the sun and had
much valuable religious matter in them along with the other statistics)
those “instructions” commanded that pen-knives, envelopes, pens and
writing-paper be furnished the members of the legislature"
956,"

Chinamen hold their dead in great reverence—they worship their departed
ancestors, in fact.  Hence, in China, a man’s front yard, back yard, or
any other part of his premises, is made his family burying ground, in
order that he may visit the graves at any and all times"
957," One trip it “barked” the Secretary’s elbow; the next trip it
hurt me in the stomach, and the third it tilted Bemis’s nose up till he
could look down his nostrils—he said.  The pistols and coin soon settled
to the bottom, but the pipes, pipe-stems, tobacco and canteens clattered
and floundered after the Dictionary every time it made an assault on us,
and aided and abetted the book by spilling tobacco in our eyes, and
water down our backs"
958,"

In our return of this day's journey, our men that made two days of
it met with a very surprising thing, that gave them some reason to be
careful how they parted company again.  The case was this:--The second
day in the morning, before they had gone half a mile, looking behind
them they saw a vast cloud of sand or dust rise in the air, as we see
sometimes in the roads in summer when it is very dusty and a large drove
of cattle are coming, only very much greater; and they could easily
perceive that it came after them; and it came on faster as they went
from it"
959,"”

“Oh, of course,” said Mr Dombey.  “I desire to make it a question of
wages, altogether.  Now, Richards, if you nurse my bereaved child, I
wish you to remember this always.  You will receive a liberal stipend in
return for the discharge of certain duties, in the performance of
which, I wish you to see as little of your family as possible"
960,"

It was a little after one o’clock.  As I entered the cabin door, tired
but jolly, the dingy light of a tallow candle revealed Higbie, sitting
by the pine table gazing stupidly at my note, which he held in his
fingers, and looking pale, old, and haggard"
961," Upon this we tacked, and stood after him with all the sail we
could, and in two hours came almost within gunshot.  Though they crowded
all the sail they could lay on, there was no remedy but to engage us,
and they soon saw their inequality of force"
962," Florence, this
lady will soon be your Mama. ”

Florence started, and looked up at the beautiful face in a conflict of
emotions, among which the tears that name awakened, struggled for a
moment with surprise, interest, admiration, and an indefinable sort of
fear"
963,"

Upon the disaster I have been speaking of you may very well suppose that
we came to an anchor as soon as we could, which was upon a small island
not far from Banda, where, though the Dutch keep no factory, yet they
come at the season to buy nutmegs and mace"
964," What has brought me to
this? That thing which you are about to tell.  Gradually but surely, that
tiresome old anecdote has sapped my strength, undermined my
constitution, withered my life.  Pity my helplessness"
965," He moved that, as our
coast was now northward, so we might slant away north-west, that so, by
crossing the country, we might perhaps meet with some other river that
run into the Rio Grande northward, or down to the Gold Coast southward,
and so both direct our way and shorten the labour; as also because, if
any of the country was inhabited and fruitful, we should probably find
it upon the shore of the rivers, where alone we could be furnished with
provisions"
966,"

“Holloa, Uncle Sol!” cried Walter, bursting into the shop, and speaking
incoherently and out of breath, from that time forth, for the rest of
the evening.  “Here’s a wonderful adventure! Here’s Mr Dombey’s daughter
lost in the streets, and robbed of her clothes by an old witch of a
woman—found by me—brought home to our parlour to rest—look here!”

“Good Heaven!” said Uncle Sol, starting back against his favourite
compass-case"
967," Then the cooking begins, and there is no smoke, and consequently
no swearing.  Such a fire will keep all night, with very little
replenishing; and it makes a very sociable camp-fire, and one around
which the most impossible reminiscences sound plausible, instructive,
and profoundly entertaining"
968,"

“You’ll take a glass yourself, Sir, won’t you?” said Miss Tox, as
Toodle appeared. 

“Thankee, Mum,” said Toodle, “since you are suppressing. ”

“And you’re very glad to leave your dear good wife in such a
comfortable home, ain’t you, Sir?” said Miss Tox, nodding and winking
at him stealthily"
969," Go to him, and tell him I have offered to carry you on board,
to try if you could persuade the captain to come on shore, and that I
would not hinder him if he was willing to venture. ""

The Dutchman seemed in a rapture at the very first word"
970," I laughed most heartily at my friend William, who, as I
said, had the direction of the siege, and had set up a ladder for the
garrison, as we called them, to get down upon, and run away.  But when
daylight came, we were all set to rights again; for there stood our
ladder, hauled up on the top of the tree, with about half of it in the
hollow of the tree, and the other half upright in the air"
971,". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

The line of points represents an interval of years.  At the end of which
time the opinion hazarded in that last sentence came to be gratifyingly
and remarkably endorsed, and by wholly disinterested persons"
972," Mrs Chick admires that Edith should be, by nature, such a
perfect Dombey; and is affable and confidential to Mrs Skewton, whose
mind is relieved of a great load, and who takes her share of the
champagne"
973,"'"" This, indeed, was amazing to us all, and more
so to those seamen among us who knew anything of the infinite attempts
which had been made from Europe, as well by the English as the Dutch,
to discover a passage that way into those parts of the world; and as
William pressed as earnestly to go on to the north to rescue those poor
men, so the ship's company began to incline to it; and, in a word, we
all came to this, that we would stand in to the shore of Formosa, to
find this priest again, and have a further account of it all from him"
974,"  Challenger struts about
like a prize peacock, and Summerlee is silent, but still sceptical. 
Another day should bring some of our doubts to an end.   Meanwhile, as
Jose, whose arm was pierced by a broken bamboo, insists upon returning,
I send this letter back in his charge, and only hope that it may
eventually come to hand"
975," However, we found them barbarous,
treacherous, and villainous enough in their nature, only civil from
fear, and therefore concluded we should soon fall into their hands when
the ship was gone. 

The sense of this wrought upon my fellow-sufferers even to distraction;
and one of them, being a carpenter, in his mad fit, swam off to the ship
in the night, though she lay then a league to sea, and made such pitiful
moan to be taken in, that the captain was prevailed with at last to take
him in, though they let him lie swimming three hours in the water before
he consented to it"
976," Its
richness is indexed by its market valuation.  The people of Humboldt
county are feet crazy.  As I write, our towns are near deserted.  They
look as languid as a consumptive girl.  What has become of our sinewy and
athletic fellow-citizens? They are coursing through ravines and over
mountain tops"
977," He evidently had money, and was spending
if freely.  Late in the evening Jack Williams and Andy Blessington
invited him down stairs to take a cup of coffee.  Williams proposed a
game of cards and went up stairs to procure a deck, but not finding any
returned"
978,":]

I followed, and without Mr.  But by following I made a fatal mistake. 
Following was entering a trap, and whatever animal suffers itself to be
caught should expect the common fate of a caged rat, as I fear events to
come will prove"
979," Upon the
whole, it was resolved to venture over for the main; and venture we did,
madly enough, indeed, for it was the wrong time of the year to undertake
such a voyage in that country; for, as the winds hang easterly all the
months from September to March, so they generally hang westerly all the
rest of the year, and blew right in our teeth; so that, as soon as
we had, with a kind of a land-breeze, stretched over about fifteen or
twenty leagues, and, as I may say, just enough to lose ourselves, we
found the wind set in a steady fresh gale or breeze from the sea, at
west, W"
980,"  He alone
had no desire to hold us against our will in a strange land.   He had
told us as much by his expressive language of signs.   That evening,
after dusk, he came down to our little camp, handed me (for some reason
he had always shown his attentions to me, perhaps because I was the one
who was nearest his age) a small roll of the bark of a tree, and then
pointing solemnly up at the row of caves above him, he had put his
finger to his lips as a sign of secrecy and had stolen back again to
his people"
981," She crouched upon the cold stone
floor outside it, every night, to listen even for his breath; and in
her one absorbing wish to be allowed to show him some affection, to be
a consolation to him, to win him over to the endurance of some
tenderness from her, his solitary child, she would have knelt down at
his feet, if she had dared, in humble supplication"
982,"

""Now,"" cried Lord John, ""now for our lives!""

We staggered through the brushwood, and even as we reached the trees
the harpies were on us again.   Summerlee was knocked down, but we tore
him up and rushed among the trunks"
983," “It’s a mistake. ”

“I say nothing about blame, Miss,” cried Miss Nipper, “for I know that
you object, but I may wish, Miss, that the family was set to work to
make new roads, and that Miss Blimber went in front and had the
pickaxe"
984,"

Upon this thought, they very prudently observed which way the cloud
seemed to point, and they turned a little out of their way to the north,
supposing it might pass by them.  When they were about a quarter of a
mile, they halted to see what it might be"
985," The novelists assailed his ill-chosen
adjectives and demolished them with a storm of denunciation and
ridicule.  And so the siege went on. 

But on the way thither the evil angel tempted him and he got drunk
again"
986,"

Thus they went away, and William came on board, and gave us a full
account of his parley with the old Dutchman, which was very diverting,
and to me instructing; for I had abundance of reason to acknowledge
William had made a better judgment of things than I"
987," We resumed undress uniform, climbed a-
top of the flying coach, dangled our legs over the side, shouted
occasionally at our frantic mules, merely to see them lay their ears
back and scamper faster, tied our hats on to keep our hair from blowing
away, and leveled an outlook over the world-wide carpet about us for
things new and strange to gaze at"
988,"  ""It's better to learn wisdom before you get into a
cookin'-pot; so we will content ourselves with hopin' that there is no
trouble waitin' for us, and at the same time we will act as if there
were.   Malone and I will go down again, therefore, and we will fetch up
the four rifles, together with Gomez and the other"
989," said that The _Phenix_ would be just the
name for it, because it would give the idea of a resurrection from its
dead ashes in a new and undreamed of condition of splendor; but some
low- priced smarty on one of the dailies suggested that we call it the
_Lazarus_; and inasmuch as the people were not profound in Scriptural
matters but thought the resurrected Lazarus and the dilapidated
mendicant that begged in the rich man’s gateway were one and the same
person, the name became the laughing stock of the town, and killed the
paper for good and all"

Fishes were killed for twenty miles along the shore, where the lava
entered the sea.  The earthquakes caused some loss of human life, and a
prodigious tidal wave swept inland, carrying every thing before it and
drowning a number of natives"
991,"

Here he gave us an account how civilly he had been used; how they had
treated him with all imaginable frankness and openness; that they had
not only given him the full value of his spices and other goods which he
carried, in gold, by good weight, but had loaded the vessel again with
such goods as he knew we were willing to trade for; and that afterwards
they had resolved to bring the great ship out of the harbour, to lie
where we were, that so we might make what bargain we thought fit;
only William said he had promised, in our name, that we should use no
violence with them, nor detain any of the vessels after we had done
trading with them"
992," W.  in Esmeralda he had been hunting for the lost mine, in
hunger and thirst, poverty and sickness, for twelve or thirteen years. 
Some people believed he had found it, but most people believed he had
not"

CHAPTER XX. 


On the seventeenth day we passed the highest mountain peaks we had yet
seen, and although the day was very warm the night that followed upon
its heels was wintry cold and blankets were next to useless"
994," I’m alone now, and I’m prepared
to be shot down just here and now rather than be villified by you as I
have been, and suffer you to escape me after publishing those charges,
not only here where I am known and universally respected, but where I am
not personally known and may be injured"
995," Finally a sad-voiced conversation
began, and it was soon apparent that in each of our hearts lay the
conviction that this was our last night with the living.  I had so hoped
that I was the only one who felt so"
996," This was the wreck of an European ship, which had been
cast away upon the rocks, which in that place run a great way into the
sea. 

We could see plainly, at low water, a great deal of the ship lay dry;
even at high water, she was not entirely covered; and that at most she
did not lie above a league from the shore"
997,"  I have already planned how it is to be
made and attached.   Meanwhile I will simply show you how capable my
apparatus is of supporting the weight of each of us. ""

""All of us, surely?""

""No, it is part of my plan that each in turn shall descend as in a
parachute, and the balloon be drawn back by means which I shall have no
difficulty in perfecting"
998," Time has altered that part of my poor expiation; and I think,
except the three heads of the House, there is no one here who knows my
story rightly.  Before the little boy grows up, and has it told to him,
my corner may be vacant"
999,"

In the early days a poverty-stricken Mexican who lived in a canyon
directly back of Virginia City, had a stream of water as large as a
man’s wrist trickling from the hill-side on his premises.  The Ophir
Company segregated a hundred feet of their mine and traded it to him for
the stream of water"
